# Overview

This document provides updated technical adequacy documentation for the Oregon
Extended Assessment (ORExt), which is Oregon's alternate assessment based on
alternate academic achievement standards (AA-AAAS). The documentation includes
test design and development, technical characteristics of the assessments, and
their uses, and impact in providing proficiency data on grade level state
standards as part of the mandates from the Every Student Succeeds Act of 2015
(ESSA).

The ORExt assessments were redesigned in 2014-15, including a vertical scale in
Grades 3-8 in English language arts and mathematics to support eventual
determinations of student growth over time. The test is aligned to
Essentialized Standards (EsSt) that are part of comprehensive Essentialized Assessment
Frameworks (EAFs) that were written at three levels of complexity (low, medium,
and high). The EsSt have been linked to grade level content and expectations,
but systematically reduced in terms of depth, breadth, and complexity (RDBC).
All ORExt items employed in the 2017-18 ORExt administration, with the
exception of Grade 7 Math field test items, were developed in
2014-15. Based on student performance from the 2016-2017 testing year, new and
Grade 7 Math field test items were written in fall 2017. An alignment study was
conducted in 2016-17 and it was determined that all items were aligned to
the new EsSt.

A statewide sample of Oregon general and special education teachers have
reviewed all test items for: 1) alignment to the EAFs, 2) accessibility for
students with significant cognitive disabilities, 3) sensitivity, and 4) bias.
All operational items met the established criteria. In addition, Achievement
Level Descriptors (ALDs) were also reviewed for alignment to the EsSt. See
Sections 1.1, 1.2, 6.1, and 6.3 for additional information related to the
comprehensive grade level standards to EsSt linkage, as well as alignment of
items to the EsSt.

The ORExt test design supports student access, including access to read aloud
for directions and prompts, presentation of one item per page, and items
designed at three levels of complexity where the low level complexity items
include graphic and/or object support. For assessors, the scoring process has
also been simplified, with answers being either correct (1) or incorrect (0).
Partial credit is no longer part of the scoring metric for the ORExt. In
addition, the one item per page format not only increases student ability to
focus attention, but also reduces the burden on assessors to mask items that 
are not being tested. The field appears to have been appreciative of the
redesign, particularly the Essentialized Standards and new access and 
efficiency features.
In addition to developing and reviewing/editing over 5,000 new items, conducting
an operational field test, and developing a vertical scale, the development of a
new ORExt required that new Alternate Academic Achievement Standards (AAAAS) be
developed and approved. Comprehensive Standard Setting meetings were conducted
on June 15-17, 2015, which were then approved by the Oregon State Board of
Education on June 25, 2015, including new achievement level descriptors (ALDs)
and cut scores for the assessments. Comprehensive Annual Measurable Objective
(AMO) reports were finalized on July 10, 2015.

Though an alignment study was conducted in the fall of 2014 as described above,
Non-Regulatory Guidance from the U.S. Department of Education, published on
September 25, 2015, included an expectation that all alignment studies must be
independent (see Critical Element 3.1). An independent contractor, Dr. Dianna
Carrizales, was therefore hired to perform an additional alignment study in the
spring of 2017. 

In addition to the independent alignment study, a pilot tablet administration
study was also conducted in the 2016-17 school year. This was the second phase
of a three-year plan. The 2017-18 school year marked the third year in which
tablet administration of the ORExt for all grades and subject areas was
available. 

As part of our five-year technical documentation plan, which included the
independent alignment study, pilot tablet administration study, and launch of
the full tablet administration, we also conducted an inter-rater reliability
study in 2017-18. The inter-rater reliability study included 33 Qualified
Trainers from around the state who participated by doing at least one Qualified
Assessor observation on the Oregon Extended Assessment via paper/pencil
administration. (List in appendix). Included in the future of the five-year plan
is continuation of the inter-rater reliability study, and analyses of the impact
of accommodations.

## Critical Element 1: Statewide System of Standards and Assessments

### 1.1 State Adoption of Academic Content Standards for All Students

The Oregon State Board of Education (SBE) adopted new, challenging academic
content standards, the Common Core State Standards (CCSS), in English language
arts and mathematics in Grades K-12 on October 28, 2010. These CCSS are utilized
for all students in Oregon's public schools. Oregon was actively involved in the
development of the CCSS, as the Oregon Department of Education (ODE), the
Educational Enterprise Steering Committee (EESC), Oregon's Education Service
Districts, and school district representatives provided feedback on the draft
CCSS standards.

Similarly, the SBE adopted the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) on March
6, 2014. The NGSS establish learning targets for all students in Oregon's public
schools in Grades K-12. The ODE and the Oregon Science Content and Assessment
Panel provided direct feedback related to the NGSS. The NGSS are being phased in
over time instructionally, so students are being assessed relative to the Oregon
Science (ORSci) standards that were adopted in 2009. \color{link} [State content
Standards](http://www.oregon.gov/ode/educator-resources/standards/Pages/default.aspx.)
\color{black}
The tables below provide examples of essentialized standards in grades 5, 8, &
11 in the subject areas of English language arts (ELA), mathematics, and
science. Complete EAF spreadsheets are available at the link provided here, as
well. In the right column are designations for estimated difficulty of an item:
L (low), M (medium), and H (high). \color{link} [Complete EAF Spreadsheets]
(http://www.brtprojects.org/publications/training-modules) \color{black}

See *Appendix* 1.1 for a User Guide that explains the development process and
intended uses for the EAFs.

![](Figures/Standards/Grade5.pdf)

![](Figures/Standards/Grade8.pdf)

![](Figures/Standards/Grade11.pdf)

\newpage

### 1.2 Coherent and rigorous Academic Content Standards 

The CCSS, ORSci, and NGSS define what students in Oregon should know and be able
to do by the time they graduate from high school. These CCSS, which were
developed by national stakeholders and education experts, have been determined
to be coherent and rigorous by researchers at the Fordham Institute (see
*Appendix* 1.2). They were also developed with wide stakeholder involvement,
particularly here in Oregon. The new ORExt is linked directly to the content in
the CCSS in English language arts (reading, writing, & language) and
mathematics. The ORExt is dually linked to the ORSci as well as the NGSS. The
NGSS are widely accepted by most relevant science instruction organizations as
reflective of rigorous and coherent science concepts \color{link}[NGSS
Link](http://www.nextgenscience.org/support-scientific-engineering-and-education-communities)
\color{black}

The new Essentialized Assessment Frameworks (EAFs) are publicly available at the
link on page 16 above in the Essentialized Assessment Frameworks section. A User
Guide is provided to instruct educators regarding the intended uses of the
Essentialized Standards (EsSt), including the development of Present Levels of
Academic Achievement and Functional Performance (PLAAFP) and Individualized
Education Program (IEP) goals and objectives. The basic essentialization process
employed to generate essentialized standards and write aligned items for the
ORExt is outlined below. The process can also be used to support the development
of curricular and instructional materials, founded in research-based pedagogy.

![](Figures/Essentialization/Essentialization.pdf)

### 1.3 Required Assessments 

The ORExt assessments were administered in the 2017-18 school year in ELA and
math in Grades 3-8 and once in Grade 11; science is assessed in Grades 5, 8, &
11. This assessment plan meets the requirements for grade level assessment in
Grades 3-8 and once in high school (Grades 10-12) for ELA and mathematics, while
science is assessed once in the 3-5 grade band, once in the 6-9 grade band, and
once in the 10-12 grade band:

| **Content Area**      | **Grade 3** | **Grade 4** | **Grade 5** | **Grade 7** | **Grade 8** | **Grade 11** |
| :-------------------- | :---------- | :---------- | :---------- | :---------- | :---------- | :----------- |
| English Language Arts | X           | X           | X           | X           | X           | X            |
| Mathematics           | X           | X           | X           | X           | X           | X            |
| Science               |             |             | X           |             | X           | X            |

### 1.4 Policies for Including All Students in Assessments 

Originally, Oregon statute required that all students participate in statewide
assessments, with exceptions allowed for district-approved parent request for
assessment waivers (parent opt-out requests) related to student disability or
religious beliefs (see Oregon Administrative Rule, OAR § 581-022-0612)

Exception of Students with Disabilities from State Assessment Testing: (1) For
the purposes of this rule a "student with a disability" is a student identified
under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, consistent with OAR
chapter 581, division 015, or a student with a disability under Section 504 of
the Rehabilitation Act of 1973; (2) A public agency shall not exempt a student
with a disability from participation in the Oregon State Assessment System or
any district wide assessments to accommodate the student's disability unless the
parent has requested such an exemption.
    
However, House Bill 2655 established a Student Bill of Rights on January 1,
2016, which permitted parents or adult students to annually opt-out of Oregon's
statewide summative assessments, pursuant to OAR § 581-022-1910.

The Governor published a memorandum for Superintendents, Principals, and
District Test Coordinators related to the change (see *Appendix* 1.4.1).

The expectation that all students in the assessed grades participate, including
students with disabilities, is elaborated clearly and pervasively across all
guidance documents. For example in the Oregon Test Administration Manual (TAM),
where it states that, "All students enrolled in grades 3-8 and in high school
must take the required Oregon Statewide Assessments offered at their enrolled
grade, including students re-enrolled in the same grade as in the prior year,
unless the student receives a parent-requested exemption..." (see *Appendix*
1.4.2, p. 93).

#### 1.4A English Learners 

English learners are included as appropriate in Oregon's statewide assessment
system. (see *Appendix* 1.4A.1, pp. 31-33). The Smarter Balanced assessment
directions are translated into multiple languages and available via the Oaks
portal. OAR 581-022-0620 (2) requires ODE to provide translated OAKS assessments
for populations at or above 9% in grades K-12 within three years after the
school year in which the language exceeds the threshold (see *Appendix* 1.4A.2).
In addition, the accommodations available to students who participate in the
ORExt include translation into the native language, where appropriate (see
*Appendix* 2.3A1, pp. 36-43).

#### 1.4B Native Language Assessments 

The ORExt is not administered in a native language format, though it can be
translated into a student's home language.

### 1.5 Participation Data 

Oregon's participation data indicate that most students in the tested grade
levels are included in our assessment system. The students with disabilities
subgroup did not meet minimum participation requirements in 2016-17, the most
current data available at the time of this report, in English language arts or
mathematics, with rates at 90.2% and 89.4%, respectively. See the table below
for a summary of participation. For complete reports, see \color{link} [Complete
reports
link](http://www.oregon.gov/ode/schools-and-districts/reportcards/Documents/rptcard2017.pdf)
\color{black}

Documentation of this requirement is provided within the Annual Performance
Report, Indicator B3, which is submitted to the United States Department of
Education's (USED's) Office of Special Education Programs (OSEP). Participation
and performance summaries are provided below. Additional information regarding
state performance is published in the 2016-17 State Report Card (see *Appendix*
1.5, pages 1-11 for student and teacher demographics and pages 21-48 for
assessment information).

## Critical Element 2 - Assessment System Operations

### 2.1 Test Design and Development 

The test specifications document that describes our approach to assessment and
test design for the ORExt is published in *Appendix* 2.1. The document includes
our approach to reducing the depth, breadth, and complexity (RDBC) of grade
level content standards, an overview of the essentialization process and EAF
documents, the planned test design for the ORExt, test development
considerations, sample test items, item specifications, and universal
tools/designated supports/accommodations. Only Grade 7 Math field test items
were developed in 2017-18 which were in accordance with the 2014-15 test
specifications, and are the most current available.

#### 2.1A ORExt Purpose

The stated purpose of the ORExt is to provide the state technically adequate
student performance data to ascertain proficiency on grade level state content
standards for students with significant cognitive disabilities. A long-term goal
of the program is to also provide information regarding annual student growth
related to these content standards over Grades 3-8, as measured by vertically
scaled assessments in ELA and mathematics. The results of the assessment are
currently reported in comparison to four performance levels: Level 1, Level 2,
Level 3, and Level 4. Levels 3 and 4 denote a proficient level of performance,
while Levels 1 and 2 denote performance that is not proficient. BRT and ODE
developed a scaled score interpretation guide to assist stakeholders in
interpreting the meaning of the scaled scores generated by the ORExt, supported
by the state's achievement level descriptors. This guidance is published in
*Appendix* 2.1A.

#### 2.1B ORExt Test Blueprint

*Appendix* 2.1B includes the entire test blueprint for the ORExt, as conveyed by
the balance of representation across content areas and domains. Field-testing is
conducted each year in order to support the continuous improvement of test
functioning. However, items are selected to maintain this balance of
representation. Oregon teachers validated the content of the assessment,
agreeing with the standards that were and were not selected to develop the
Essentialized Standards to which the ORExt test items are aligned.

#### 2.1C Test Development Processes

The test development process implemented for the ORExt is conveyed in *Appendix*
2.1C, including standard selection and validation, item development, item
review, review of all Oregon teacher feedback and updating of items, and scaling
and item selection. The *Appendix* articulates the process used to generate the
materials with comma separated value files used to create item templates that
fed into Adobe InDesign© through a data merge. Final test packages are reviewed
for accuracy and content and then disseminated via secure file transfer to
Oregon Qualified Assessors.

#### 2.1D Computer-Adaptive Considerations

The ORExt is not a computer-adaptive instrument, so these concerns do not apply.

### 2.2 Item Development

Item writers were recruited by ODE staff using an existing Qualified
Assessor/Qualified Trainer listserv.
![](Figures/ItemDev/ItemDev.pdf)

####Project Description:

Behavioral Research and Teaching at the University of Oregon recruited Oregon
teachers to participate in item development for a new alternate assessment.
Selected teachers were asked to develop 360 items in English Language Arts,
Mathematics, or Science over the course of the summer, from mid-June through end
of August. The Project Director worked with lead item developers to provide
training, ongoing review and feedback, and quality assurance. All participants
were expected to provide documentation of their qualifications and sign test
security agreements. In addition, all item developers were expected to
participate in a half-day item development training based upon the following
schedule:
    "	ELA - Tuesday, from 8 AM to 12 PM 
    "	Math - Wednesday, from 8 AM to 12 PM 
    "	Science - Thursday, from 8 AM to 12 PM
    
#### Minimum Qualifications:

All licensed Oregon public school teachers with at least three years of teaching
in a life skills/severe needs program (SPED) or a general education classroom
(GEN-ED), respectively, were encouraged to apply. Preference was given for
item writing experience, additional years of teaching experience, and higher
education degree status.

#### Compensation:

Teachers who participate in this process were compensated at a rate of \$20/hr
via professional service contracts. It was anticipated that teachers would
produce 4 ELA items/hr, 6 Science items/hr, and 8 Math items/hr. As such, the
maximum contract amount for ELA was \$1,800, for Science \$1,440, and for Math
\$900. Item development focused primarily on writing the stem and 3 options,
with no need to produce graphics (rather use labels for a BRT graphic designer
to produce).

#### Contact:

Because the timeline required work over the summer, Oregon teacher recruitment
was challenging. BRT researchers thus performed an additional on-campus
recruitment within the College of Education using the same information. The
final pool of item writers included 18 item writers: seven Oregon teachers (all
with MA degrees), five PhD candidates within the COE, and six BRT researchers
(four PhD candidates, one PhD, and one with an MA). Item writers averaged 11.5
years of teaching experience. The teachers recruited all had prior experience
developing items for the ORExt, as did all of the BRT researchers. The five PhD
candidates within the COE had no prior item development experience. All item
development was reviewed by BRT researchers and the Project Manager.

The item development process followed is elaborated in *Appendix* 2.2.1, which
is the PowerPoint used in training all Oregon item writers. The item development
process was structured with the following steps. Item writers were first
oriented to the student population, as the pool of item writers included both
content and special education experts. The Essentialization Process used to RDBC
grade level standards was then modeled so writers would understand how the item
alignment targets, the Essentialized Standards, were generated. Lecture, guided
practice, and independent practice activities and follow-up discussion ensured
comprehension of the process. BRT staff developed exemplar items for every
Essentialized Standard, varying the complexity from Low (L) to Medium (M) to
High (H) levels of complexity to convey the different performance expectations
at each level. The balanced vertical scaling design provided an overall
form-to-form and grade-to-grade level framework for the test formation process
once items were developed (see *Appendix* 2.2.2). Sample items are provided in
*Appendix* 2.2.3 for stakeholder reference, demonstrating the format and style
of typical items on the ORExt.

### 2.3 Test Administration

The ORExt assessments are administered according to the administration, scoring,
analysis, and reporting criteria established in the ORExt General Administration
Manual (see *Appendix* 2.3). Important updates to the testing process are
distributed via the Assessment and Accountability Updates listserve, as well.
\color{link} [Updates
link](http://www.oregon.gov/ode/educator-resources/assessment/Pages/Assessment-and-Accountability-Update.aspx)
\color{black} ODE uses this system to communicate information that is relevant
for the statewide assessment system, including the ORExt. Announcements are sent
to the listserv by email and are also posted to the ODE website. The
standardization of test administration is supported by a comprehensive training
process described below in Section 2.3B.

#### 2.3A Administration and Accommodations

The state has ensured that appropriate universal tools, designated supports, and
accommodations are available to students with disabilities and students covered
by Section 504 by providing guidance and technical support on accommodations
(see Appendices 2.3A.1 and 2.3A.2). Guidelines regarding use of the
accommodations for instructional purposes are included in the document, as all
students are expected to receive test accommodations that are consistent with
instructional accommodations.

Accommodations are built into the flexibility provided by the ORExt test though
they have not yet been researched for the ORExt. However, annual training and
proficiency testing efforts related to becoming a qualified assessor and/or
qualified trainer for the ORExt support standardized use of available
accommodations that are not already part of the test design. Based on annual
analyses, results demonstrate that student performance varies according to their
abilities and not construct-irrelevant factors, such as sex, race, or ethnicity
(See Section 4.2).

The state has ensured that appropriate accommodations are available to students
with limited English proficiency by providing guidance and technical support on
accommodations (see *Appendix* 2.3A.1). Communication systems for this student
population are limited; exposure to multiple languages can make a student's
communication system more complex. The ORExt uses universal design principles
and simplified language approaches in order to increase language access to test
content for all students. In addition, directions and prompts may be
translated/interpreted for students in their native language.

An analysis of accommodated versus non-accommodated administrations is needed in
order to demonstrate that the provision of language accommodations is not
providing any advantage to students with limited English proficiency, nor any
disadvantage to other participants. Accommodations information was collected
this year as an option for data entry. Entering accommodations information will
be required next year. Analyses of the impact of accommodation provision on the
ORExt should thus be feasible after the spring 2018 administration.

The Oregon Extended assessments can be administered using both Large Print and
Braille (contracted and non-contracted) versions, as well. Oregon has ensured
that the Oregon Extended assessments provide an appropriate variety of
accommodations for students with disabilities. The state has provided guidance
on accommodations in presentation, response, setting, and timing in the
Accommodations Manual 2013-14: How to Select, Administer, and Evaluate
Accommodations for Oregon's Statewide Assessments (see *Appendix* 2.3A.2). The
Oregon Extended assessments are also designed according to universal design
principles and utilize a simplified language approach (see *Appendix* 2.3A.3).

In the 2013-2014 school year, the state developed a training and proficiency
program for sign language interpretation of its assessments and has updated the
site annually since that time. The training process \color{link}[Training
link](http://lms.brtprojects.org) \color{black} included videos of interpreters
administering items to students, materials that support appropriate
administration (i.e., transcripts and PowerPoint slides that supplement the
video administrations and the current ODE accommodations manual), and
proficiency testing to support standardized interpretation for Oregon's
assessments, including the ORExt. A 10-item proficiency test was administered,
with an 80% required for passing (8/10 items correct). In 2017-18, the site was
used to train 61 participants. All participants passed the assessment on the
first attempt. The overall average score on the proficiency test was 95.9%.

The ORExt assessments provide an appropriate variety of linguistic
accommodations for students with limited English proficiency. They also use a
simplified language approach in test development in order to reduce language
load of all items systematically (see *Appendix* 2.3A3). Any given student's
communication system may include home signs, school signs, English words, and
Spanish words, for example. With the exception of items that require independent
reading, the ORExt assessment can be translated or interpreted by a Qualified
Assessor (QA) working with an interpreter in the student's native language,
including American Sign Language. QAs are allowed to translate/interpret the
test directions. QAs can adapt the assessment to meet the needs of the student,
while still maintaining standardization due to systematic prompts and
well-defined answers.

#### 2.3B Comprehensive Training System

Comprehensive information for ongoing training for all qualified assessors (QAs)
and Qualified Trainers (QTs) is provided in Appendices 2.3B.1-2.3B.8. Training
and QA/QT proficiency is determined annually via an online distribution and
assessment system located at \color{link} [QA/QT website
link](https://or.k12test.com/) \color{black}. This website hosts all resources
and information needed to administer, score, report, and interpret the results
from the ORExt. The website also includes proficiency assessments that are
required for all QAs and QTs who may administer the ORExt. QTs are directly
trained by ODE and BRT staff as part of a train the trainers model. QTs then
provide direct trainings for new QAs in their respective regions.

The Oregon Department of Education (ODE) provided four direct statewide
trainings for new Qualified Trainers (QTs) and Qualified Assessors (QAs) in
face-to-face regional trainings. The schedule for the regional trainings, as
well as relevant training information, is provided below: 

![](Figures/TrainingSched/TraingSched.pdf)

Only trained Qualified Assessors (QAs) can administer the Oregon Extended
assessment. Qualified Assessors who also receive direct instruction from ODE and
BRT may become Qualified Trainers (QTs) who are certified to train local staff
using the train-the-trainers model. Training for new assessors must be completed
on an annual basis. Assessors who do not maintain their respective
certifications for any given year must re-train if they choose to enter the
system again.

The tables below contain data from the Oregon Extended Assessment Training and
Proficiency Website \color{link} [QA/QT website link](http://or.k12test.com/)
\color{black}. All assessors need to complete some form of training each year to
retain their status for administering the Extended Assessments.

New assessors and returning assessors who needed further training in 2017-18
were required to pass four proficiencies with a score of 80% or higher. These
four proficiencies were in Administration, English Language Arts (ELA),
Mathematics, and Science. Returning QAs or QTs for the 2017-18 school year only
needed to pass a Refresher Proficiency, again with a score of 80% or higher. The
tables below contain data on the number of assessors (participants) in each of
the four proficiencies, as well as the Refresher Proficiency. Included in the
data is the number of attempts needed to attain a passing score as well as the
average passing score of the participants.

An analysis of the Oregon Extended Assessment Training and Proficiency Website
showed 409 Assessors in-Training, 947 Qualified Assessors, and 143 Qualified
Trainers.

![](Figures/TestPartic/TestParticipants.pdf)

A higher number of assessors completed the Refresher Proficiency test than the
subject area proficiency tests reflecting a greater number of return assessors
compared to new assessors. Administration Proficiency continued to be the most
challenging to new assessors, but most were able to pass on the first or second
attempt with less than 1% of assessors requiring more than two attempts. The
majority of assessors passed the ELA, Math, Science, and the Refresher
proficiency tests on the first attempt with less than 2% requiring a second or
third attempt. There were 83 fewer Qualified Assessors but 6 more Qualified
Trainers compared to last year.

Evaluations are collected at each QT training in November. The results reflect
general approval, but also suggest areas of improvement that ODE and BRT work on
for subsequent trainings/subsequent years, as appropriate. QT evaluations this
year included positively worded statements regarding the quality of training
rated on a scale where 1 = Strongly Disagree, 2 = Disagree, 3 = Agree, and 4 =
Strongly Agree.

The first section evaluated the state-level information and the knowledge of the
ODE presenters, the participants' level of comfort with the training provided,
the participants' ability to carry this training and materials back to train
district staff, and the overall utility of the training. Seventy-six percent
of participants strongly agreed with these statements, 24% agreed, and less than
3% disagreed and strongly disagreed, collectively. In the second section,
participants were asked to evaluate the BRT trainers and their guidelines
regarding how to use the training and proficiency website and related resources.
Seventy-nine percent of participants strongly agreed with these statements, 19%
agreed, and less than 2% disagreed and strongly disagreed, collectively.
Overall, these results demonstrate that participants felt that the training was
high quality and they felt confident that they could train their staff upon
return to their respective districts with the knowledge and resources gained.
This year's QT training cycle included an optional afternoon session for any
interested educators on how to essentialize grade level content standards and
how to develop curriculum and provide instruction that is aligned to those
standards for students who are functioning off grade level, with a focus on
students with significant cognitive disabilities (SWSCD). We asked participants
to rate their confidence in using the knowledge acquired during the session as
well as to evaluate the quality of the presentation and materials. A four-point
scale was employed (Strongly Disagree, Disagree, Agree, Strongly Agree).
Percentages of responses for each statement used in the survey are provided
below. The table provides a summary of the data related to participant
confidence and their evaluation of the quality of the
presentation. The respondent n-sizes ranged from 26-30, depending upon the
question. 

Note: Results are very positive, with some reviewers feeling less confident
about their abilities to train others about the essentialization process. This
outcome was expected. The process is complex, particularly given the
understanding that this was the first time they had received such training.

In addition, all technical assistance questions that we receive from the field
as part of our *HelpDesk* are documented. The log of the technical assistance
provision is reviewed each month, as well as annually, in order to determine
what aspects of our assessment system need further clarification or improvement.
The *HelpDesk* log is published in *Appendix* 2.3B.9.

Oregon monitors the quality of its system in several ways in order to support
continuous improvement. In terms of the assessment quality, item statistics are
reviewed each year and items that are not functioning as intended are removed
and replaced by better functioning field-test items.

In 2014-15, items were reviewed in two phases, first using classical test theory
(CTT) and second using Rasch analyses. All items flagged as a result of the
statistical reviews were analyzed, item-by-item, by a team of measurement and
content experts at BRT. Not all flagged items were removed, as several did not
have apparent design flaws. Considerations regarding domain representation as
well as item difficulty range also were considered during the review process. We
also employed different decision rules for unique items versus horizontally- or
vertically-scaled anchor items. It was important in many cases to maintain
anchor items. Items with clear design flaws were removed from subsequent
analyses and reporting. The following flagging criteria were employed:

* **CTT**: A unique item was flagged if it had a p-value of .10 or lower, .90 or
higher, or a point biserial < .15. Anchor items were flagged if they had a
p-value of .10 or lower or .95 and higher on all forms or a point biserial < .45
on any form.
* **Rasch**: Unique items were flagged if their outfit mean square values were
between 0 and .25 or > 1.5. Anchor items were flagged if their outfit mean
square values were < .5, > 1.8 for horizontal items, or > 2.0 for vertical
anchor items.

Out of a total of 5,929 items developed in 2014-15, 166 were removed (2.8%).

We also implement a consequential validity study each year that surveys QAs and
QTs regarding the academic and social consequences of the ORExt, both intended
and unintended. The Consequential Validity report is published in *Appendix*
2.3B.10. ODE and BRT staff review the results of the survey annually to
determine what program improvements are needed. A summary of the results is
provided below.

ODE implemented a research survey program to address the need to document the
consequences, both intended and unintended, of the ORExt Assessments. The
research questions have been framed based upon current consequential validity
approaches for alternate assessments in the literature, as well as issues that
are of specific value in Oregon. The survey included 121 respondents. This was
11% of the solicited respondents, who were all Qualified Assessors (QAs) and
Qualified Trainers (QTs) in the or.k12test.com database. The sample was 83%
female and represented all regions of the state, as well as age ranges. The
survey included a range of quantitative and qualitative components. The
quantitative results demonstrate that QAs and QTs continue to feel that the
ORExt test items were easy to administer and score (64.2% Strongly Agree) and
felt confident in their ability to interpret scaled scores and Achievement Level
Descriptors for the ORExt (69.8% Strongly Agree and Agree). They also felt that
the items were accessible for students who participated (78% Strongly Agree and
Agree) and that the ORExt reflected the academic content that SWSCD should be
learning (68.4% Strongly Agree and Agree). QAs and QTs felt marginally positive
about the educational impacts of the ORExt and marginally negative about its
social impacts. The results again demonstrate that the ORExt content area
assessments generally require up to one hour to administer.

The qualitative results revealed two areas in which educators appreciated the
ORExt and four areas of needed improvement. QAs and QTs said that they
appreciated: 1) the assessment's efficiency (i.e., more streamlined
administration, ease of administration, easier to give and score online, online
materials distribution); and, 2) overall item and test design (i.e., one item
per page, visual supports, scoring protocol and student materials design,
accessibility of test questions). Teachers recommended the following areas of
improvement, not all of which are actionable: 1) Option to administer the
assessment electronically, 2) A functional skills assessment, 3) New items for
very low functioning students should be developed, and 4) A math assessment
composed of more practical/life skills problems involving time and money.
Complete results, including anticipated responses, from the survey can be found
in *Appendix* 2.3B.10.

#### 2.3C Technology-based Assessments

The ORExt was implemented using a technology-based platform as Phase 3 of the
ORExt Tablet Administration. The 2017-18 testing window was the first
year all grade level and subject area assessments were available
on a tablet application/web-based platform. Administration of the tablet
application mirrors paper/pencil administration with each item read aloud to
the student, and the student asked to select one of three answer choices. 
Tablet functionality includes optional discontinuation if the student misses 10
out of the first 15 items, directing the assessor to administer the
ORora. To support understanding of the system by both teachers and students, a
separate practice test tablet application is available. Helpdesk inquiries and
feedback from the field indicated much preference of the tablet administration
versus paper/pencil. Qualified Trainers and Qualified Assessors reported their
students' were more focused during tablet administration, and because the tablet
application scores automatically it was much more efficient for assessors. 
Based on data and feedback from the field, improvements will be made to the
tablet application/web-based platform, and additional training will be provided
for the 2018-19 testing year. The paper/pencil version will continue to be
available for students who cannot access a tablet administration. For the
2017-18 testing window, data entry for the paper/pencil version was maintained
by ODE. Beginning in 2018-19, all test platforms and data entry will be through
the BRT servers, monitored by BRT. 

### 2.4 Monitoring Test Administration

The ODE maintains a rigorous training system to support standardized test
administration for the ORExt, located at \color{link}
[link](https://or.k12test.com)\color{black} (secure website, but see screenshot
below for an example of training content).

![](Figures/TrainingSite/TrainingSite.pdf)

The or.k12test.com website includes a training section that addresses any
systems updates, the process for becoming a Qualified Assessor or Qualified
Trainer, student eligibility expectations, student confidentiality and test
security, test administration and scoring expectations, examples of appropriate
and inappropriate administration (video), supporting student access to items
without violating the test construct, content area trainings that demonstrate
how to administer items in ELA, Math, and Science (video, with supporting test
materials), and how to access secure tests and complete data entry. Information
for QAs, QTs, and parents regarding the ORExt is also provided, as are all
necessary support materials. For QAs, these materials include practice tests to
prepare both themselves and students for the annual assessment and all of the
training materials used on the website. In addition to these materials, QTs have
access to all training materials necessary to provide annual training to QAs in
their purview (see screenshot below):

![](Figures/TrainingSite/Downloads.pdf)

In addition, monitoring and reporting related to test administration issues for
the ORExt is addressed via general ODE reporting systems. Information regarding
this process can be located in the general assessment system Peer Review
evidence submission.

### 2.5 Test Security

#### 2.5A Prevention of Assessment Irregularities

Test security policies and consequences for violation are addressed in the Test
Administration Manual on an annual basis (see *Appendix* 1.4.2, p. 29-33). These
policies include test material security, proper test preparation guidelines and
administration procedures, consequences for confirmed violations of test
security, and annual training requirements at the district and school levels for
all individuals involved in test administration. Consequences for
adult-initiated test irregularities may be severe, including placing teaching
licenses in jeopardy (see *Appendix* 1.4.2, p. 31-33).

#### 2.5B Detection of Test Irregularities

The ODE utilizes a localized monitoring system where school test coordinators
oversee building-level administration by trained, Qualified Assessors, and
report to centralized district test coordinators, who are then responsible for
reporting any confirmed violations to ODE. Improprieties are defined as
adult-initiated or student-initiated and investigated accordingly (see *Appendix*
1.4.2, p. 29-31).

#### 2.5C Remediation Following Test Security Incidents

ODE's alternate assessment program manager investigates and remediates
substantiated test security incidents for the ORExt by working with district
test coordinators. Additional information regarding this process can be located
in the general assessment system Peer Review evidence submission.

#### 2.5D Investigation of Test Irregularities

School and district test coordinators conduct initial investigations into all
alleged test irregularities. Once reported to ODE, all alleged test
irregularities are investigated in consultation with district test coordinators
and the test vendor, as appropriate (see *Appendix* 1.4.2, p. 31-33). In the event
that a test irregularity is determined to be factual, consequences are
determined based upon contextual issues that are brought to light during the
investigation. Additional information regarding this process can be located in
the general assessment system Peer Review evidence submission.

### 2.6 Systems for Protecting Data Integrity and Privacy

#### 2.6A Integrity of Test Materials

Test materials for the ORExt are maintained throughout development,
dissemination, and administration via multiple mechanisms. All items under
development are stored in secure file servers managed by Behavioral Research &
Teaching at the University of Oregon, the test vendor for the ORExt. Item
reviews necessary to provide alignment, bias, and sensitivity information are
conducted online using the secure Distributed Item Review (DIR) platform
\color{link} [DIR link](http://brtitemreview.com) \color{black} (secure website,
but see *Appendix* 3.1B for a system overview).

For the 2017-2018 school year, all paper/pencil secure test distribution and
data entry was hosted by ODE's secure file transfer system, which is a
password-protected test distribution and data entry system located at \color
{link} [Secure file link](https://district.ode.state.or.us/apps/login/) \color
{black} (secure website, but see screenshot below for reference). A data entry 
guide is provided in *Appendix* 2.6.

The secure tablet application and web-based platform distribution and data entry
were hosted by BRT servers. All technology based secure administration and data
entry was password-protected. Download of the tablet app was dependent on the
type of device, all instructions and download links were available in the Test
App User Guide (see *Appendix* 2.6A)


![](Figures/TrainingSite/SecureSite.pdf)

Additional information regarding test security can be located in the general
assessment system Peer Review evidence submission.

#### 2.6B Secure Student-Level Assessment Data

Student level data is protected by relevant training and through a secure data
system in which all data entry is conducted online using password-protected,
secure procedures on the \color{link} [Oregon K12
website](https://or.k12test.com) \color{black} or \color{link} [Secure data
link](https://district.ode.state.or.us/apps/login/) \color{black} websites, as
identified above. Only trained users with a vested educational interest who have
signed test security agreements are authorized to access to online data entry
systems. See *Appendix* 2.6 for additional data entry expectations for 2017-18.

#### 2.6C Protecting Personally Identifiable Information

All confidential, personally identifiable student information is protected by
policy and supported by training (see *Appendix* 1.4.2, p. 26). The minimum
number of students necessary to allow reporting of students and student
subgroups varies by rating (i.e., achievement, growth, graduation, and school
size), by level (i.e., school/district/state), and by number of years of
assessment data available. For example, to receive an achievement rating,
schools must have at least 40 tests for the two most recent school years in
reading or mathematics. Alternatively, small schools receive an achievement
rating if they have at least 40 tests over the most recent four years. If a
school does not have at least 40 tests over a four-year period, they will not
receive an achievement score (see *Appendix* 2.6C). Similar rules are applied to
student subgroups, including students with disabilities, English learners, and
students from diverse racial/ethnic backgrounds (see *Appendix* 2.6C, p. 7).

## Critical Element 3 - Technical Quality: Validity

### 3.1 Overall Validity, Including Validity Based on Content

As elaborated by Messick (1989) , the validity argument involves a claim with
evidence evaluated to make a judgment. Three essential components of assessment
systems are necessary: (a) constructs (what to measure), (b) the assessment
instruments and processes (approaches to measurement), and (c) use of the test
results (for specific populations). Validation is a judgment call on the degree
to which each of these components is clearly defined and adequately implemented.

Validity is a unitary concept with multifaceted processes of reasoning about a
desired interpretation of test scores and subsequent uses of these test scores.
In this process, we want answers for two important questions. Regardless of
whether the students tested have disabilities, the questions are identical: (1)
How valid is our interpretation of a student's test score? and (2) How valid is
it to use these scores in an accountability system? Validity evidence may be
documented at both the item and total test levels. We use the Standards  (AERA
et al., 2014) in documenting evidence on content coverage, response processes,
internal structure, and relations to other variables. This document follows the
essential data requirements of the federal government as needed in the peer
review process.  The critical elements highlighted in Section 4 in that document
(with examples of acceptable evidence) include (a) academic content standards,
(b) academic achievement standards, (c) a statewide assessment system, (d)
reliability, (e) validity, and (f) other dimensions of technical quality.

In this technical report, data are presented to support the claim that Oregon's
AA-AAAS provides the state technically adequate student performance data to
ascertain proficiency on grade level state content standards for students with
significant cognitive disabilities - which is its defined purpose. The AA-AAAS
are linked to grade level academic content, generate reliable outcomes at the
test level, include all students, have a cogent internal structure, and fit
within a network of relations within and across various dimensions of content
related to and relevant for making proficiency decisions. Sample items that
convey the design and sample content of ORExt items are provided in *Appendix*
2.2.3.

The assessments are administered and scored in a standardized manner. Assessors
who administer the ORExt are trained to provide the necessary level of support
for appropriate test administration on an item-by-item basis. There are four
levels of support outlined in training: full physical support, partial physical
support, prompted support, and no support. Items were designed to document
students' skill and knowledge on grade level academic content standards, with
the level of support provided designed not to interfere with the construct being
measured. Only one test administration type is used for the ORExt, patterned
after the former Scaffold version of the assessment. Assessors administer the
prompt and if the student does not respond, the Assessor reads a directive
statement designed to focus the student's attention upon the test item and then
repeats the prompt. If the student still does not respond, the Assessor repeats
the prompt as needed and otherwise scores the item as incorrect and moves on to
the next item. Training documentation is provided in *Appendices* 2.3B.1-2.3B.8.

Given the content-related evidence that we present related to test development,
alignment, training, administration, scoring, the reliability information
reflected by adequate coefficients for tests, and, finally, the relation of
tests across subject areas (providing criterion-related evidence), we conclude
that the alternate assessment judged against alternate achievement standards
allows valid inferences to be made on state accountability proficiency
standards.

#### 3.1A Alignment Between AA-AAAS and Academic Content Standards (DELETED)

Our foundation of validity evidence from content coverage for the ORExt comes in
the form of test specifications (see *Appendix* 2.1) and test blueprints (see
*Appendix* 2.1B). Among other things, the Standards (AERA et al., 2014)2 suggest
specifications should "define the content of the test, the proposed test length,
the item formats…" (Standard 4.2, p. 85)^2^.

All items are linked to grade level standards and a prototype was developed
using principles of universal design  with traditional, content-referenced
multiple-choice item writing techniques. The most important component in these
initial steps addressed language complexity and access to students using both
receptive, as well as expressive, communication. Additionally, both content
breadth and depth were addressed. We developed one test form for the ORExt that
utilizes a scaffold approach. This approach allows for students with very
limited attention to access test content, while the supports are not utilized
for students who do not need this support.

We developed the test iteratively by developing items (see *Appendix* 2.2.1,
which conveys our item writer training materials), piloting them, reviewing
them, and editing successive drafts. We used a combination of existing panels of
veteran teachers who have worked with the Oregon Department of Education (ODE)
in various advising roles on testing content in general and special education,
using the same processes and criteria, as well as the introduction of newer
teachers who are qualified as we proceed to remain relevant. Behavioral Research
and Teaching (BRT) personnel conducted the internal reviews of content. After
the internal development of prototype items, all reviews then involved Oregon
content and special education experts with significant training and K-12
classroom experience.

The ORExt incorporates continuous improvement into its test design via
field-testing in all content areas on an annual basis, with an average of 25%
new items. These items are compared to operational items based on item
functioning and test design factors, generating data used to replace items on an
annual basis, incorporating the new items that fill a needed gap with regard to
categorical concurrence, or provide for a wider range of functioning with regard
to complexity levels: low - medium - high, comparable to Webb's DOK (see
Section 3.1A).

BRT employed a multi-stage development process in 2014-15 to ensure that test
items were linked to relevant content standards, were accessible for students
with significant cognitive disabilities, and that any perceived item biases were
eliminated. The item review process included 51 reviewers with an average of 22
years of experience in education. The ORExt assessments have been determined to
demonstrate strong linkage to grade level academic content, overall. Full
documentation of the initial 2014 linkage study and a new, independent alignment
study conducted in spring, 2017 is provided in *Appendix* 3.1A. Based on student 
performance from the 2016-2017 testing year, new and Grade 7 Math field test 
items were written in fall 2017.

The summary section of the independent alignment study report states that,
"Oregon's Extended Assessments (ORExt) in English Language Arts, Mathematics,
and Science were evaluated in a low-complexity alignment study conducted in
Spring of 2017. Averages of reviewer professional judgments over five separate
evaluations were gathered, reviewed, and interpreted in the pages that follow.
In the three evaluations that involved determining the relationship between
standards and items, reviewers identified sufficient to strong relationships
among assessment components in all grades and all subject areas. In the two
evaluations involving Achievement Level Descriptors, reviewers identified thirty
instances of sufficient to strong relationships out of thirty-four possible
relationship opportunities resulting in an overall affirmed relationship with
areas for refinements identified."

Because the assessments demonstrate sufficient to strong linkage to Oregon's
general education content standards and descriptive statistics demonstrate that
each content area assessment is functioning as intended, it is appropriate to
deduce that these standards define the expectations that are being measured by
the Oregon Extended assessments.

The Oregon Extended assessments yield scores that reflect the full range of
achievement implied by Oregon's alternate achievement standards. Evidence of
this claim is found in the standard setting documentation submitted in Section
6.2. Standards were set for all subject areas on June 15-17, 2015. Standards
included achievement level descriptors and cut scores, which define Oregon's new
alternate achievement standards (AAS). The State Board of Education officially
adopted the AAS on June 25, 2015.

#### 3.1B AA-AAAS Linkage to General Content Standards

Complete results of the analysis of the linkage of the new Essentialized
Assessment Frameworks, (EAF), composed of Essentialized Standards (EsSt), to
grade level CCSS in English language arts and mathematics and linked to ORSci
and NGSS in science, are presented in Section 3.1A. The claim is that the EsSt
are sufficiently linked to grade level standards, while the ORExt items are
aligned to the EsSt. In addition to presenting linkage information between grade
level content standards and the EsSt, the linkage study presents alignment
information related to the items on the new ORExt in comparison to the EsSt.
Extended assessments have been determined to link sufficiently to grade level
academic content standards. Field test items are added each year based on item
alignment to standards.

The Oregon Extended assessments link to grade level academic content, as
reflected in the item development process. Oregon also had each operational item
used on the Oregon Extended assessment evaluated for alignment as part of two
comprehensive linkage studies, one performed in 2014 and an independent
alignment study performed in 2017 (see Section 3.1A). The professional reviewers
in an internal study in 2014 and an independent study in spring 2017 included
both special and general education experts, with content knowledge and
experience in addition to special education expertise.

According to the independent linkage study report (see *Appendix* 3.1A), the
spring 2017 review was conducted by expert reviewers with professional
backgrounds in either Special Education (the population), Assessment, or in
Oregon's adopted content standards. Reviewers were assigned to review
grade-level items relative to their experience and expertise. In all, 39
reviewers participated. Thirty-four (34) participated in all 5 evaluations:
thirteen (13), for the English Language Arts review, fifteen (15) for the
Mathematics review, and six (6) for the Science review. All participants were
assigned to at least one specific content area as shown in Table 1. Note: Four
individuals were assigned to two areas of review. The thirty-nine individuals
who participated in the study had a robust legacy of experience in the field and
in the state. Participants represented 25 unique school districts across the
state representing both urban and rural perspectives. All 39 of the individuals
participating in the study held current teaching licenses. Two individuals also
held administrative licenses. Years of experience in their area ranged from 3 -
30 years of experience with an average of 17 years of experience. (Mode = 11
years, Median = 16 years). One individual indicated 50 years of experience in
the field. Three of the 39 individuals held a Bachelor's degree only. Thirty-six
held a Bachelor's degree and at least one Master's degree. Two held a Bachelor's
degree, at least one Master's degree, and a doctoral degree. Fourteen (36%) of
the individuals identified as experts in a specific Content area and 25 (64%) of
the individuals identified Special education as their primary area of expertise.

These skilled reviewers were trained by synchronous webinars on
linkage/alignment, as well as item depth, breadth, and complexity and then
completed their ratings online via BRT's Distributed Item Review (DIR) website
and on Excel spreadsheets shared with the researcher electronically (see
*Appendix* 3.1B for an overview). Mock linkage ratings were conducted in order
to address questions and ensure appropriate calibration. Reviewers rated each
essentialized standard on a 3-point scale (0 = no link, 1= sufficient link, 2=
strong link) as it related to the standard the test developers had defined for
that essentialized standard. Items were evaluated, in turn, based upon their
alignment to the essentialized standard on a 3-point scale (0 = insufficient
alignment, 1 = sufficient alignment, 2 = strong alignment). When averaged across
reviewers, 1.00-1.29 was considered in the low range, 1.30 - 1.69 was
sufficient, and 1.70 - 2.0 was strong. Additional comment was requested for any
essentialized standard or item whose linkage was rated 0.

Overall, the 2017 independent alignment study concludes that: "First, reviewers
were asked to conduct an affirmational review of the rationale used by test
developers to omit certain content standards. This finding was used to infer
that the final standards selected for inclusion or omission in Oregon's Extended
Assessment were chosen rationally and that the final scope of content standards
can be considered justifiable for the population for the subject area.
  Conclusion: This review, with a lowest average rate of .82 (on a scale of 1),
  permits the inference: the scope of the standards selected for translation to
  Essentialized Standards were rationally selected. None of the standards
  de-selected (for inaccessibility or for being covered elsewhere) were strongly
  identified for re- inclusion, nor were identified as a critical hole for this
  population of students. 
Second, reviewers were asked to identify the strength of the link between the
source standard and the Essentialized Standard. This finding was used to infer
that the process undertaken to essentialize a given Source Standard did not
fundamentally or critically alter the knowledge or skill set intended by the
source standard for this population of students (further confirming that the
content selected for assessment is comparable).
  Conclusion:This review, with a range of 1.5 - 1.9 (on a scale of 2) permits
  the inference: the Essentialized Standards were found to link sufficiently to
  the source standards on average beyond the "sufficient" average of 1.0.
Third, reviewers were asked to identify the strength of the alignment between
the Essentialized Standards and the items and to review the items developed
using the Essentialized Standards for bias, and accessibility. The finding from
this review was used to infer that the items written for this grade and subject
area (using these Essentialized Standards) were adequately linked to the
Essentialized Standards, were free from bias, and were accessible to students
with significant cognitive disabilities.
  Conclusion: The alignment review (1.32 - 1.89), accessibility review (.67 -
  1.0), and freedom from bias review (.65 - 1.0) all permit the inference that
  the test items indicate a relationship with the source standards, the test
  items are not overly biased towards or against any particular group of
  individuals, and the test items are written such that the content and intent
  can be accessed by students with the most significant cognitive disabilities.
  (**Note: this range was skewed by feedback from one reviewer --ELA-Grade 3 -
  whose comments were noted in this study. Removing that individual's comments
  would result in a range of .90 - 1.0 accessibility range and .89 - 1.0
  freedom from bias range respectively.)
Fourth, reviewers were asked to review the statements used to describe student
achievement on the test (the Achievement Level Descriptors) and their alignment
to the Essentialized Standards that the students were tested on. The finding
from this review was used to infer that the skills and achievements described by
the Achievement Level Descriptors for each subject and grade level are aligned
with the content standard being measured.
  Conclusion: The reviews ranging from .68* - 1.0 permit the inference that the
  descriptions made regarding student skillset are an accurate reflection of the
  standards from which the assessment was developed at all three levels
  evaluated. (*One outlier for ELA-Grade 4 provided a review of a .52 average).
Fifth, and finally, reviewers were asked to review the alignment of the
Achievement Level Descriptors to the items. The finding from this review was
used to infer that each item in the developed assessment(s) was appropriately
aligned to its associated Achievement Level Descriptor (further confirming that
decisions made using this test were aligned with the intent of the source
standard).
  Conclusion: Fourteen of the seventeen grade-level reviews resulted in an
  average reviewer range of .67 - 1.0 indicating an appropriate alignment
  between ALDs and the items as written. This review permits the inference that,
  overall, the Achievement Level Descriptors are accurate reflections of the
  items. In three instances (Mathematics-Grades 3 and 4, and ELA-Grade 8) the
  average alignment by reviewer was .5 (indicating that one of the two
  individuals in that category did not agree that the items and ALDs were
  aligned)."

### 3.2 Validity Based on Cognitive Processes

Evidence of content coverage is concerned with judgments about "the extent to
which the content domain of a test represents the domain defined in the test
specifications" (AERA et al., 2014, Standard 4.12, p. 89)^7^. As a whole, the
ORExt is comprised of sets of items that sample student performance on the
intended domains. The expectation is that the items cover the full range of
intended domains, with a sufficient number of items so that scores credibly
represent student knowledge and skills in those areas. Without a sufficient
number of items, the potential exists for a validity threat due to construct
under-representation (Messick, 1989)^6^.

The ORExt assessment is built upon a variety of items that address a wide range
of performance expectations rooted in the CCSS, NGSS, and ORSci content
standards. The challenge built into the test design is based first upon the
content within each standard in English language arts, mathematics, and science.
That content is RDBC in a manner that is verified by Oregon general and special
education teachers to develop assessment targets that are appropriate for
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities. Our assessments
utilize universal design principles in order to include all students in the
assessment process, while effectively challenging the higher performing
students. For students who have very limited to no communication and are unable
to access even the most accessible items on the ORExt, an Oregon Observational
Rating Assessment (ORora) was first implemented in 2015-16. The ORora is
completed by teachers and documents the student's level of communication
complexity (expressive and receptive), as well as level of independence in the
domains of attention/joint attention and mathematics. A complete report of ORora
results from 2017-18 is provided in *Appendix* 5.1D.

Fifty-one reviewers analyzed all ORExt items for bias, sensitivity,
accessibility to the student population, and alignment to the Essentialized
Standards. A total of 21 reviewers were involved in the English language arts
item reviews. An additional 21 reviewers were involved in the Mathematics item
reviews. Science employed nine reviewers. Reviewers were organized into grade
level teams of two special educators and one content specialist.

Substantive evidence that has been documented suggests that the ORExt items are
tapping the intended cognitive processes and that the items are at the
appropriate grade level through the linkage/alignment studies documented above,
including reviews of linkage, content coverage, and depth of knowledge. A
comprehensive report of the item review process is available in *Appendix* 3.1A.

### 3.3 Validity Based on Internal Structure (Content and Function)

The Oregon Extended assessments reflect patterns of emphasis that are supported
by Oregon educators as indicated by the following three tables that highlight
the balance of standard representation by grade level for English language arts,
mathematics, and science on the ORExt. The representation ratios can be
calculated by dividing the standards by the total within each respective column.
For example, in Grade 3 Reading, approximately 25% of the items are in the
Reading Standards for Literature domain, as that domain has 4 written
Essentialized Standards (EsSt) out of the total of 16 (4/16 = 25%).

The test blue prints below directly correspond to the number of ES written in
each domain within the Essentialized Assessment Frameworks (EAF) spreadsheets.
There are additional grade level standards addressed by the EsSt, as some EsSt
link to multiple grade level content standards. However, the blueprints below
reflect only the written EsSt and are thus an underrepresentation of the breadth
of grade level content addressed by the ORExt.

![](Figures/EsSt/EsSt.pdf)

The primary purpose of the ORExt assessment is to yield technically adequate
performance data on grade level state content standards for students with
significant cognitive disabilities in English language arts, mathematics, and
science at the test level. All scoring and reporting structures mirror this
design and have been shown to be reliable measures at the test level (see
Section 4.1). The process of addressing any gaps or weaknesses in the system is
accomplished via field-testing (see Section 3.1A).

#### Point Measure Correlations

Distributions of point measure correlations and outfit mean square statistics
for operational items are provided below, by content area and grade. Point
measure correlations display how the item scores correlate with the latent
overall score, while outfit mean square statistics closer to 1.0 denote minimal
distortion of the measurement system. All items included in the 2017-18
operational assessment are represented. Point measure correlations in ELA ranged
from 0.42 to 0.74. All data visualizations were conducted with ggplot in the
tidyverse package (Wickham, H., 2017).

```{r ifiles}
ifiles <- dir_ls(file.path("data", "ifiles18"))

read_sub_files <- function(file) {
  read_csv(file) %>% 
    mutate(content_area = 
             str_extract(file, "[Ee][Ll][Aa]|[Rr]dg|[Ww]ri|[Mm]ath|[Ss]ci"),
           grade = gsub(".+g(\\d\\d*).+", "\\1", file),
           grade = as.numeric(grade)) %>% 
    select(content_area, grade, everything())  %>% 
    clean_names()
}

ifiles <- map_df(ifiles, read_sub_files)

ptm_tbls <- ifiles %>% 
  group_by(content_area, grade) %>% 
  summarize(mean_ptm = mean(point_measure_corr),
            min_ptm  = min(point_measure_corr),
            max_ptm  = max(point_measure_corr)) %>% 
  rename(Grade = grade,
         Mean  = mean_ptm, 
         Min   = min_ptm,
         Max   = max_ptm) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  nest(-content_area)

ptm_tbls$content_area <- c("English/Language Arts", "Math", "Science")

walk2(ptm_tbls$data, 
      paste0("Point Measure Correlations: ", 
             ptm_tbls$content_area), 
      ~kable(.x, 
             "latex", 
             booktabs = TRUE, 
             caption = .y,
             digits = 2) %>% 
        kable_styling(full_width = TRUE,
                      latex_options = "hold_position") %>% 
        print())
```

#### Outfit Mean Square Distributions 

Outfit mean square values below 1.0 demonstrate that values are too predictable
and perhaps redundant, while values above 1.0 indicate unpredictability. Items
above 2.0 are deemed insufficient for measurement purposes and flagged for
replacement. While most OMS values in ELA were between 0.5 and 1.5, one item in
Grade 6 was above 2.0 and was removed.

```{r outfit}
outfit_tbls <- ifiles %>% 
  group_by(content_area, grade) %>% 
  summarize(mean_ptm = mean(outfit),
            min_ptm  = min(outfit),
            max_ptm  = max(outfit)) %>% 
  rename(Grade = grade,
         Mean  = mean_ptm, 
         Min   = min_ptm,
         Max   = max_ptm) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  nest(-content_area)

outfit_tbls$content_area <- c("English/Language Arts", "Math", "Science")

walk2(outfit_tbls$data, 
      paste0("Mean Square Outfit: ", 
             outfit_tbls$content_area), 
      ~kable(.x, 
             "latex", 
             booktabs = TRUE, 
             caption = .y,
             digits = 2) %>% 
        kable_styling(full_width = TRUE,
                      latex_options = "hold_position") %>% 
        print())
```

#### Annual Measureable Objectives Frequencies & Percentages 

Annual Measurable Objective (AMO) calculations were conducted based upon student
performance on the ORExt tied to the vertical scale using Rasch modeling.
Overall results are largely consistent with 2016-17, with approximately 50% of
students with significant cognitive disabilities achieving proficiency across
grades and content areas. ELA results are presented in blue, mathematics in dark
green, and science in red. The data visualizations presented below were
conducted with ggplot in the tidyverse package (Wickham, H., 2017).

```{r ode_data}

         perc_overall_p = map2(perc_overall,
                               paste0(content_area, " Percent Proficient"),

                                     title = .y)))

  walk2(nested_perc$perc_overall,

        ~mutate(.x, amo_lvl = paste0("AMO Level ", amo_lvl)) %>% 
          rename(Grade = grade) %>% 
          spread(amo_lvl, percent) %>% 
          knitr::kable("latex", 
                       booktabs = TRUE,
                       caption = paste0(stringr::str_to_title(.y),
                                        " Percent Proficient By Grade"),

                      latex_options = "hold_position") %>% 
          print())
```


```{r amo_plot}
walk(nested_perc$perc_overall_p, print)
```

Some concerns are noted in mathematics, where relatively higher percentages of
students are scoring at Level 1 and very few at Level 2. However, this finding
is consistent with the range of possible scores, where Level 2 in some cases
only has two possible scale score points (e.g., Grade 7, where Level 2 exists
between 207-208 scaled scores). The addition of 1-2 low complexity items per
assessment will be effected in mathematics to address this concern, as well.

### 3.4 Validity Based on Relations to Other Variables 

Perhaps the best model for understanding criterion-related evidence comes from
Campbell and Fiske (1959)  in their description of the multi-trait, multi-method
analysis [we translate the term 'trait' to mean 'skill']. In this process
(several) different traits are measured using (several) different methods to
provide a correlation matrix that should reflect specific patterns supportive of
the claim being made (that is, provide positive validation evidence). Sometimes,
these various measures are of the same or similar skills, abilities, or traits,
and other times they are of different skills, abilities, or traits. We present
data that quite consistently reflect higher relations among items within an
academic subject than between academic subjects. We also present data in which
performance on items is totaled within categories of disability, expecting
relations that would reflect appropriate differences (see Tindal, McDonald,
Tedesco, Glasgow, Almond, Crawford, & Hollenbeck, 2003).

#### Convergent and Divergent Validity Documentation 

Criterion validity information is difficult to document with AA-AAAS, as most
SWSCD do not participate in any standardized assessment outside of the ORExt
and/or ORora in Oregon. Divergent validity evidence is garnered via comparisons
of ORExt results to ORora outcomes shows that students whose ORExt assessments
are discontinued exhibit serious limitations in attention, basic math skills,
and receptive and expressive communication skills. The median ORExt ELA score
for SWSCD who participated in the ORora was 4.0. The median mathematics ORExt
score was 4.0, and the median science ORExt score for SWSCD who were evaluated
with the ORora was 0.0. Pearson correlations between the total raw scores on the
ORExt and the total raw score on the ORora were conducted to address the
relationship between total performance on each assessment. The correlation
between ELA and ORora scores was 0.56, between Math and ORora scores was 0.52,
and between Science and ORora scores was 0.33. As expected, the ORora results
provide divergent validity evidence for the ORExt. We would not expect a strong
relationship between the scores, as students whose ORExt testing is discontinued
are generally unable to access the academic content on the ORExt, even with the
requisite reductions in depth, breadth, and complexity.

Convergent evidence that the ORExt is assessing appropriate academic content is
provided by QA and QT responses to the consequential validity survey.
Respondents to the survey generally agree that, "The items in the Oregon
Extended Assessment accurately reflect the academic content (what the student
should know) that my students with significant cognitive disabilities should be
learning, as defined by grade level content standards (CCSS/NGSS) and the
Essentialized Assessment Frameworks" (17% Strongly Agree & 51% Agree). In
addition, they also agreed with the statement that, "The items in the Oregon
Extended Assessment, which primarily ask students to match, identify, or
recognize academic content, are appropriate  behaviors to review to determine
what my students with significant cognitive disabilities are able to do" (22%
Strongly Agree & 63% Agree). The consequential validity results demonstrate that
the ORExt is sampling academic domains that the field of QAs and QTs deem
appropriate in the area of academics.

#### Analyses Within and Across Subject Areas 

We conducted correlational analyses to further explore the validity of the
ORExt. We first describe the purpose of the analysis, as well as our anticipated
results. We then discuss our observed results before concluding with an overall
evaluative judgment of the validity of the test.

In the correlational analysis, we explore the correlations among students' total
scores across subject areas. The purpose of the analysis was to investigate how
strongly students' scores in one area were related to students' scores in other
subject areas. If the correlations were exceedingly high (e.g., above .90), it
would indicate that the score a student receives in an individual subject has
less to do with the intended construct (i.e., reading) than with factors
idiosyncratic to the student. For example, if all subject areas correlated at
.95, then it would provide strong evidence that the tests would be measuring a
global student-specific construct (i.e., intelligence), and not the individual
subject constructs. We would expect, however, that the tests would correlate
quite strongly given that the same students were assessed multiple times.
Therefore, we would expect moderately strong correlations (e.g., 0.7) simply
because of the within-subject design. Idiosyncratic variance associated with the
individual student is thus captured.

#### Correlational Analyses Results 

Full results of the Pearson's product-moment correlation analysis by content area
and grade level are reported below. The results are significant, yet the overall
correlations across content areas suggest that we are indeed measuring
different, though strongly related constructs, with between-test scaled score
correlations ranging from 0.81 to 0.89.

```{r by_sub_corr}
cors <- ode %>% 
  select(content_area, grade, ssid, theta) %>% 
  mutate(content_area = case_when(content_area == "ela" ~ "ELA",
                                  content_area == "math" ~ "Math",
                                  content_area == "rdg" ~ "Reading",
                                  content_area == "wri" ~ "Writing",
                                  content_area == "sci" ~ "Science")) %>% 
  spread(content_area, theta) %>% 
  select(-ssid) %>% 
  nest(-grade) %>% 
  mutate(data = map(data, ~remove_empty(., "cols")),
         cor  = map(data, ~correlate(.) %>% shave()),
         cor  = map(cor, ~rename(., Variable = rowname)))


walk2(cors$cor,
      cors$grade, 
      ~knitr::kable(.x, "latex", booktabs = TRUE,
                     caption = paste0("Grade ", 
                                      .y, 
                                      " Content Area Correlations"),
                    digits = 2) %>% 
        kable_styling(full_width = TRUE,
                      latex_options = "hold_position") %>% 
        print())
```

Results of the Pearson's product-moment correlation analysis within English
language arts (ELA:Reading:Writing) are reported below and suggest high
correlations between ELA and Reading, as expected, from .95 to .97. Writing is
correlated with ELA from .91 to .94 and with reading from .79 to .88.

English Language Arts Subscore Correlations table here:

The ORExt assessments appear to be measuring separate constructs, as intended,
indicated by the correlations. No unexpected and consistent test functioning
statistics are present based on student characteristics that should not be
related, such as gender and ethnicity. Student performance appears to be
primarily related to item difficulty and not the result of construct irrelevant
aspects that have been reviewed.

## Critical Element 4 - Technical Quality: Other 

### 4.1 Reliability

Test reliability can be viewed through several lenses, all of which document how
consistently an assessment performs across occasions, contexts, and raters.
Typical strategies for addressing reliability include documentation of internal
consistency, split-half reliability, and test-retest reliability. If multiple
forms are implemented, test form reliability documentation is also requisite.
The implementation plan for the ORExt includes initial documentation of internal
consistency (Cronbach's alpha). The 2015-16 technical report included
internal consistency estimates, split-half reliability analyses, as well as a
small test-retest assessment of reliability comparisons by means of our pilot
tablet administration study. There is only one test form for the ORExt, so test
form comparisons are not possible.

#### Inter-Rater-Reliability

##### Background

ODE’s technical documentation plan (see page 136 in the 2016-17 Technical Report), included an inter-rater reliability study for the 2017-18 school year, pursuant to IRR study here (McHugh, 2012). A sample of Oregon’s Qualified Assessors (QAs) who administer the paper/pencil version of the Oregon Extended Assessment (ORExt) were observed to determine reliability of administration and scoring. We did not include the tablet administration or the Oregon Observational Rating Assessment (ORora). The study was conducted in two manners:
1)	QTs in districts across the state observed a sample of their respective QAs using the observation protocol and enter their data online.
2)	Expert reviewers from Behavioral Research & Teaching (BRT) observed district-level QTs and those QAs who give the assessment in more than one school/district.
The observation protocol was completed for the identified QA, but the student(s) and content area(s) observed were selected by the QT or QA. BRT researchers contacted district-level QTs at the beginning of the test window, which runs from February 15 - April 26, 2018, to arrange observations that could hopefully be completed within one school day. 
In addition to addressing inter-rater reliability, the study also evaluated test administration procedures. The methods, results, and interpretation are provided below, in addition to recommended next steps. The observation was composed of three sections:

•	First, QT’s reviewed ORExt paper/pencil test preparation and administration using the rubric (*Appendix 4.1 InterRater_Observation_Form*). Test preparation/administration domains were rated on a four-point scale from **Inappropriate (I)** to **Exemplary (E)**:

**o	Inappropriate (I)** denotes a level of concern that could clearly affect the accuracy of the test results gathered from the test administration. Ratings at this level require substantive retraining of the QA involved.

**o	Somewhat Appropriate (SA)** rating denotes a level that includes some minor aspects that could be improved, but the accuracy of the test results are likely not compromised.

**o	Appropriate (A)** denotes a level that is consistent with all test administration requirements.

**o	Exemplary (E)** level performance suggests that the QA incorporated approaches to test administration that could become models for best practice.

•	Second, QT’s scored the student alongside the QA using the scoring sheet (Appendix 4.1 InterRater_Observation_Form). QT’s compared results after this observation to ensure that the QA entered accurate data.

•	Finally, QT’s observed the QA completing the data entry process to ensure that no errors are made during data entry and document the number of errors (*Appendix 4.1 InterRater_Observation_Form*).

Qualified Assessor Testing Preparation and Administration Rubric
(Record an “X” in the cell that corresponds to your rating)

Domain Definitions
1.	Test Security – The QA utilized a system to ensure that all test materials were stored in a secure location,. The QA also had a district Assurance of Test Security form on file.
2.	Printed Materials – the QA had all materials required to administer the ORExt ready for test administration 
3.	Distraction-Free Environment – the QA arranged to provide the ORExt in a one-on-one test administration in a location that ensured that the student focused attention on the assessment.
4.	Accessibility Supports – the QA provided all necessary accessibility supports for the student and ensured that all support systems were functional prior to testing.
5.	Level of Support – The QA provided an appropriate level of support throughout testing that did not compromise the validity of the score.
6.	Praise – The QA utilized praise appropriately to support student involvement without leading the student to the correct answer.
7.	Motivation – The QA appropriately maintained the student’s motivation during the assessment using relevant strategies, such as token systems.
8.	Score Interpretation – The QA demonstrated an appropriate understanding of how to use the cut scores and achievement level descriptors to interpret scores (i.e., ask the QA to describe how they interpret scores for parents).
9.	Minimum Participation Rule - The QA demonstrated an appropriate understanding of the minimum participation rule (i.e., ask the QA to define the rule if it is not used).


#### 4.1A Test Reliability 

Marginal reliability results (true score variance/true score variance + error
variance) demonstrate that the tests are quite reliable at the total test level.
Full reliability statistics for each of the operational tests administered this
year are provided below. These results demonstrate that the total test
reliabilities were quite high, ranging from .87 to .92. Each table below
provides the content area, grade, and the marginal reliabilities. All test forms
were composed of 36 operational and 12 embedded field-test items.

```{r marginal_rel}
marg_rel <- function(theta, se) {
  s <- var(theta)
  e <- mean((se)^2)
  s/(s+e)
}
tbls <- ode %>% 
  group_by(content_area, grade) %>% 
  summarize(marg_rel = marg_rel(theta, se)) %>% 
  rename(Grade = grade, 
         `Marginal Reliability Estimate` = marg_rel) %>% 
  split(.$content_area) %>% 
  map(~ungroup(.) %>% select(-content_area))

walk2(tbls,
      paste0(c("ELA", "Math", "Reading", "Science", "Writing"),

### Validation of ORExt Vertical Scales

The test characteristic curves (TCCs) for the grade-level assessments in ELA and
mathematics demonstrate incrementally increasing growth and test demands across
Grades 3-8, with the exception of Grade 7 mathematics. The Grade 7 mathematics
assessment was revised to be more difficult last year, but clearly more
elaboration of this effort is needed to address its location on the TCC. Grade
11 and science tests are not vertically scaled; TCCs are thus not presented for
Grade 11 or science. All Rasch model scaling, as well as the data visualizations
for the TCCs were conducted in the R software 3.3.2 environment (R Core Team,
2016) using the r2Winsteps package (Anderson, 2015).

#### 4.1B Overall and Conditional Standard Errors of Measure

The average SEM associated with each cut score for 2017-18 student data are
presented in the table below, supported by a KEY. The SEMs decreased in almost
all cases compared to last year, suggesting that the measures are more reliable
when student eligibility is more strictly controlled. See Section 4.2 below for
means and standard deviations by grade and subject area. SEM = Standard Error of
Measure associated with the cut score to the left; averaged to the tenths'
place. Level 1 = Does Not Yet Meet (not included as the lowest level of
proficiency) Level 2 = Nearly Meets Level 3	= Meets Level 4	= Exceeds

#### 4.1C Classification Accuracy & Consistency

Results from the 2017-18 ORExt test administration were analyzed using Rudner's
classification index (Rudner, 2005). Results closer to 1.0 indicate the
likelihood that a student was appropriately classified as proficient or not
proficient (accuracy) and the likelihood that the student would be classified in
the same category given an additional test administration. The calculation
utilizes item difficulty and theta value distributions, as well as related
standard errors of measurement, to generate probabilistic estimates based on one
test administration. Complete results, generated from the cacIRT package in R,
are provided below. Results denote very high levels of classification accuracy
and consistency.

```{r class_acc}
cuts <- ode %>% 
  group_by(content_area, grade, amo_lvl) %>% 
  summarize(cut = min(theta)) %>% 
  filter(amo_lvl > 1)

diffs <- map_df(dir_ls(file.path("data", "ifiles18")), read_sub_files)

cuts <- diffs %>% 
  select(content_area, grade, difficulty) %>% 
  nest(-content_area, -grade) %>% 
  mutate(ip = map(data, ~as.matrix(data.frame(1, .$difficulty, 0))),
         content_area = tolower(content_area)) %>% 
  left_join(cuts)

         accuracy = map_dbl(marginal, 1),
         consistency = map_dbl(marginal, 2)) %>%

The ORExt is not a computer-adaptive instrument so estimate precision
documentation based upon that test design is not provided.

### 4.2 Fairness and Accessibility 

The state has taken steps to ensure fairness in the development of the
assessments, including an analysis of each test item by Oregon teachers not only
for linkage to standards, but also for access, sensitivity, and bias (see
*Appendix* 3.1A). In addition, we reviewed test functioning as relevant to
race/ethnicity and disability subgroups. This process increases the likelihood
that students are receiving instruction in areas reflected in the assessment,
and also that the items are not biased toward a particular demographic or
sub-group.

#### Differential Item Functioning Analyses 

To investigate Differential Item Functioning (DIF), the Mantel-Haenszel test
using a purification process was conducted (Holland & Thayer, 1988; Kamata &
Vaughn, 2004) with the R software using the difR package (Magis et al., 2013).
When using the Mantel-Haenszel test to investigate DIF, contingency tables are
constructed, and the resulting odds for the focal group answering the item
correctly are compared to the odds for the reference group. Given n-size
limitations (Scott, et al., 2009), we were able to conduct two analyses: a)
White/Non-White and b) Male/Female. Whites and Males were the focal groups and
Non-Whites and Females were the reference groups, respectively. The contingency
table summarizes correct and incorrect responses to each item by respondents'
total raw score by subgroup (Kamata & Vaughn, 2004). If there is no difference
in performance for the two groups, the odds ratio of the focal group performance
to reference group performance will equal one. An odds ratio greater than one
means the focal group is performing better than the reference group, with the
opposite being true for odds ratios less than one. 

The difR package contains a built in algorithm to conduct purification
automatically, so we were interested in how this algorithm functioned relative
to the iterations conducted manually using SPSS. We used criteria outlined by
the Educational Testing Service (ETS) for DIF Classification (Holland & Thayer,
1988) to determine whether or not items exhibited DIF, as the difR package
reports delta values by default, defined as $$\Delta_{MH} =
-2.35*ln(\alpha_{MH})$$ <!-- ln〖(α〗_mh)=β_(〖MH〗_i ). --> <!-- where  The Holland
and Thayer criteria for ∆_MH is as follows: --> <!-- |∆_MH |≤1.0 = "A" items,
--> <!-- 1≤|∆_MH |≤1.5 = "B" items, and --> <!-- |∆_MH |≥1.5 = "C" items.  -->

The Holland and Thayer criteria were used for all Mantel-Haenszel analyses.
Items that were flagged as "C" level items were reviewed by BRT researchers for
potential biases. If biases are identified, the item is removed from the item
pool. DIF analyses were performed ex post facto on the 2015-16 ORExt operational
items to address longitudinal trends. Only three ELA items were identified as
exhibiting a "C" level DIF across both 2017 and 2018. Those three ELA items, one
in Grade 5 that exhibited DIF that privileged White examinees, one in Grade 4
that privileged Female examinees, and one in Grade 8  that privileged Female
examinees, were removed and were not used in 2017-18 or thereafter. DIF
analyses was also be performed in the 2017-18 school year to continue to
address DIF longitudinally. All items, including field test items, were included
in the analyses. There are a total of 48 items on each assessment.

Within the White/Non-White analysis, 10 out of 18 items flagged as "C" level
items privileged Non-White test participants in ELA, 2 out of 5 privileged
Non-White test participants in Mathematics, and 2 out of 7 privileged Non-White
test participants in Science. Overall, DIF flagging bases on race was relatively
balanced, with 14 privileging students who were Non-White and 16 privileging
students who were White.

#### Race - Ethnicity Percentages and Totals by Content Area and Grade Level 

The full ethnic and disability demographics for students taking the ORExt are
reported below. Students ethnicity/race was reported in seven categories: (a)
American Indian/Alaskan Native, (b) Asian, (c) Black or African-American, (d)
Multi-ethnic, (e) Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, (f) Hispanic, or
(g) White. The majority of students were reported as White (55-62%) or Hispanic
(22-29%). These results are largely consistent with the demographics reported
for the general assessments, though percentages taking the ORExt are slightly
higher for most students of color and generally lower for students who are Asian
or White (see *Appendix* 4.2).

```{r eth_perc}
d %>% 
  mutate(grade = map(data, "ssidenrlgrdcd"),
         ethniccd = map(data, "ethniccd")) %>% 
  select(grade, content, ethniccd) %>% 
  unnest() %>% 
  group_by(grade, content) %>% 
  count(ethniccd) %>% 
  mutate(percent = (n/sum(n))*100) %>% 
  select(-n) %>% 
  spread(ethniccd, percent, fill = 0) %>% 
  rename(Grade = grade, 
         Content = content,
         Asian = A,
         Black = B,
         Hispanic = H,
         `Am Ind` = I,
         Multiethnic = M,
         `Pac Isl` = P,
         White = W) %>% 
  kable("latex", 
        booktabs = TRUE,
        caption = "Race/Ethnicity Proportions",
        digits = 2) %>% 
        kable_styling(full_width = TRUE,
                      latex_options = "hold_position")
```

Student reported exceptionalities included Intellectual Disability (ID), Hearing
Impairment (HI), Visual Impairment (VI), Deaf-Blindness (DB), Communication
Disorder (CD), Emotional Disturbance (ED), Orthopedic Impairment (OI), Traumatic
Brain Injury (TBI), Other Health Impairment (OHI), Autism Spectrum Disorder
(ASD), and Specific Learning Disability (SLD). The majority of students who
participated in the ORExt were students with ID (30-45%) and students with ASD
(28 -34%), followed by students with OHI (11 -16%). ODE policy for 2015-16
changed to require students who participate in the ORExt to take the assessment
in all relevant content areas. There is thus very little change in terms of
participation percentages across content areas, as evidenced by the total
n-sizes per grade level displayed below.

#### Exceptionality Percentages By Content Area and Grade Level

```{r disab_perc}

```

#### Observed Means and Standard Deviations 

The following tables provide information regarding observed means and standard
deviations by content area and grade level. The Grade 3-8 English language arts
and mathematics scaled scores are centered on 200, while all Grade 11 scores are
centered on 900 (to reinforce that they are not on the vertical scale). Science
is centered on 500 at Grade 5 and centered on 800 at Grade 8. The vertically
scaled scores generally convey incremental gains in achievement across grade
levels, though the results suggest small losses appearing at Grade 8 in ELA.
These scales were selected to clearly determine whether scores are on the same
scale and also to differentiate among the statewide assessments in use to avoid
confusion (i.e., SBA, OAKS, ORExt, ELPA, KA). The general pattern is that RIT
scores decreased from 2014-15 to 2015-16. This decrease is attributed not to the
scale, nor to deceleration of growth, but to the substantive shift in the tested
student population as a result of ODE eligibility guidelines. The scale from
2015-16 to 2016-17 appears to have stabilized because the student population
tested was more consistent.

#### Observed Means Reported by Exceptionality Status 

The following tables provide information regarding average student performance
by grade level and exceptionality category in each of the content areas assessed
on the ORExt. Students with SLD were generally the highest performing group,
though students with CD and ED performed higher at certain grade levels/content
areas. The lowest performing group was consistently students with OI, followed
by students with ID or ASD, depending upon grade level.

```{r disab_means}
disab_descrip_tbls <- ode %>%

        print())
```

#### Graphs of Observed Means By Disability 

The graphs below convey information similar to that shared above in graphic
form.

The graphics include 95% confidence interval error bars, so determining
which subgroups performed in a manner that is significantly better than others
is readily apparent by looking at the location of the error bars. Error bars
that do not overlap in terms of the y-scale are significantly different. Only
students who generally had more than 10 members at each grade level are
reported. This required the removal of graphs for students in the HI, VI, DB,
and TBI categories.

Students with OI are again the lowest performing group, being significantly
outperformed by all other subgroups. Students with SLD are consistently
outperforming most peers, with students with ED and CD performing at similarly
high levels.

Students with OI are consistently the lowest performing group, which led to
concerns regarding test accessibility. However, the results of last year's
consequential validity study demonstrated that the OI label is insufficient to
fully describe the severity and range of concomitant disabilities that students
whose primary label is OI conveys.

### 4.3 Full Performance Continuum 

The ORExt is designed to sample the Common Core State Standards in English
language arts (Reading, Writing, and Language) and Mathematics, as well as the
Oregon Science Standards and Next Generation Science Standards in science in a
purposive, validated manner. The ORExt test blueprints convey the balance of
representation exhibited by the assessment (see *Appendix* 2.1B). These test
blueprints are supported by the ORExt Extended Assessment Frameworks
\color{link} [Test blueprints
link](http://www.brtprojects.org/publications/training-modules) \color{black},
which define the assessable content on the ORExt that has been reduced in depth,
breadth, and complexity (RDBC) using our defined process (see *Appendix*
2.3A.3). The decisions regarding which standards to target for essentialization,
as well as the strength of linkage between the Essentialized Standards and the
CCSS/ORSci/NGSS has been validated by Oregon teachers, as well (see *Appendix*
3.1A).

Though a simplified and standardized approach was taken to design items, and
efficiency and access to the assessment increased for the majority of students
(as evidenced by the decreased percentages of zero scores across all content
areas), a small subgroup of students remains who cannot access an academic
assessment. This is true even though items have been significantly RDBC at three
levels of complexity (low-medium-high difficulty). As a response, ODE
commissioned BRT to design and implement an observational rating scale for this
group of very low-performing students, called the Oregon Observational Rating
Assessment (ORora) for the spring 2016 administration. The ORora targets
communication (expressive and receptive) and basic skills (attention/joint
attention and mathematics) and provides documentation of student progress
outside of our clearly defined academic domains.

Items on all assessments were scored on a 2-point scale, with 1 point awarded
for a correct response and 0 points awarded for an incorrect response. Plots are
provided below for each content area and grade level, including the person
ability and item difficulty distributions. In general, the descriptive
statistics suggest that the test had an appropriate range of item difficulties
represented, from easy to difficult, with item difficulties generally ranging
from -4.0 to +4.0 on the Rasch scale. The assessments performed as expected
across all grades and content areas with the exception of Grade 7 mathematics,
as noted above. The item person distributions provided below demonstrate that
the ORExt is providing a performance continuum for students who participate.

### 4.4 Scoring 

All scoring expectations for the ORExt are established within the Administration
Manual (see *Appendix* 2.3, p. 14). The scoring procedures for the new ORExt
have been simplified, with students receiving a 0 for an incorrect response or a
1 for a correct response. Input from the field gathered from Consequential
Validity studies demonstrates that the assessment scoring procedures are much
more clear and easier to implement than prior scoring approaches (see *Appendix*
2.3B.10). BRT was also commissioned to develop a scaled score interpretation
guide, which describes specific strategies for interpreting student test scores
and sub-test scores in Reading and Writing, and Achievement Level Descriptors
(ALDs) published within the Individual Student Reports (see *Appendix* 6.4C) for
annual performance, growth, and as part of Essential Skills requirements for
very low performing students (see *Appendix* 2.1A).

### 4.5 Multiple Assessment Forms 

The ORExt was administered in only one grade level form for the 2016-17 school
year, with 36 operational items arranged in order of empirical difficulty and 12
embedded field test items.

### 4.6 Multiple Versions of An Assessment 

The ORExt is provided in the standard format, but is also available in Large
Print and Brailled formats. Test content is identical across all three versions,
with an occasional item being eliminated on the Braille version due to
inaccessibility. These items do not count for or against the student in
reporting. Substantive test comparability analyses are not feasible, given the
small n-sizes of the samples involved in the alternative versions.

### 4.7 Technical Analyses and Ongoing Maintenance 

The ORExt technical analyses that document reliability and validity are included
in this technical report (see Sections 3 and 4, respectively). ODE and BRT staff
review these analyses annually. Necessary adjustments to the assessment are
determined prior to implementation of the subsequent year's work plan, which
elaborates the areas of improvement as well as aspects of the testing program
that will be maintained. This decision-making is supported by input from the
field gathered from the Consequential Validity study (see *Appendix* 2.3B.10).

Within our system of ongoing improvement is continuation of the development of
additional curricular and instructional resources. This addresses an area of
concern expressed by stakeholders. Training modules and templates continue to be
developed to connect assessment results from the ORExt and ORora with curricular
resources and instructional strategies aligned to the standards. 

## Critical Element 5 - Inclusion of All Students

### 5.1 Procedures for Including SWDs 

The Oregon assessment system provides explicit guidance regarding the
participation of all public school students in its statewide assessment program
(see Section 1.4).

#### 5.1A Clear Explanations of the Differences Between Assessments 

The assessment options for all public school students in Oregon are elaborated
in the Oregon Test Administration Manual (see *Appendix* 1.4.2, p. 7). These
options include the Smarter Balanced Assessment in English language arts and
mathematics in Grades 3-8 & 11, the Oregon Assessment of Knowledge and Skills in
science in Grades 5, 8, & 11, and in the same content areas and grade levels for
SWSCD who take the ORExt (see *Appendix* 1.4.2, p. 92-93). Social studies
assessment is a district option within the OAKS portal, as well. In addition,
expectations for the English Language Proficiency Assessment (ELPA) and the
Kindergarten Assessment are provided.

#### 5.1B Eligibility Decisions Made by IEP Teams 

A student's IEP team determines how a student with disabilities will participate
in the Oregon Statewide Assessment program. The IEP team must address the
eligibility criteria for participation in the ORExt before determining that the
assessment is the appropriate option (see *Appendix* 5.1B).

#### 5.1C Guidelines for Assessment Selection 

As noted earlier, IEP teams make decisions regarding how students with
disabilities participate in the Oregon statewide assessment program. At present,
students participate in one of three options: (a) student takes the general
assessment with or without universal tools. (b) student takes the general
assessment with designated supports and/or accommodations, or (c) student takes
the ORExt. Guidelines for making universal support, designated support, and
accommodations decisions for the general assessments are provided in *Appendix*
2.3A.1. Guidelines for making these determinations for SWSCD who participate in
AA-AAAS are provided in *Appendix* 5.1B.

#### 5.1D Information on Accessibility Options 

Information regarding accessibility options for the general assessment can be
found with the general assessment Peer Review evidence. For the ORExt,
accessibility is treated holistically, with universal design for assessment
concepts embedded in the item design and a wide variety of accommodations also
available if needed. Items are crafted to be visually simple and clean. Graphic
supports, which are always black/white line drawings, are embedded in all items
at the low level of complexity but are phased out as items become more complex.
Items are designed to incorporate simplified language unless specific academic
vocabulary and concepts is what is being tested (see *Appendix* 2.3A.3). The
items on the ORExt are all selected response, with three response options
allowing for multiple modes of access (e.g., saying the answer, pointing to the
answer, eye gaze, switch, etc.). All text presented to students is at least
18-pt font (larger, of course, in the large print version). Sample items are
presented in *Appendix* 2.2.3. All accessibility supports, designated supports,
and accommodations for the ORExt are published in *Appendix* 2.3A.1, p. 36-43.
For students who have very limited to no communication and are unable to access
even the most accessible items on the ORExt, an Oregon Observational Rating
Assessment (ORora) was implemented in 2015-16. The ORora is completed by
teachers and documents the student's level of communication complexity
(expressive and receptive), as well as level of independence in the domains of
attention/joint attention and mathematics. The administration instructions and
2017-18 results for the ORora are included in *Appendix* 5.1D.

#### 5.1E Guidance Regarding Appropriate Accommodations 

Guidance regarding appropriate accommodations is published in *Appendix* 2.3A.1.
District and School Test Coordinators provide annual training on test security
and administration. The ORExt approaches access as part of test design, as noted
above in Section 5.1D. The complexity of SWSCD communication systems demands
such an approach. In addition, comprehensive accommodations are allowed in order
to decrease the chances that a disability may interfere with our ability to
measure the student's knowledge and skills.

#### 5.1F All SWDs Eligible for the ORExt 

ODE's eligibility guidelines make it clear that all SWDs are eligible for the
ORExt, regardless of disability category, and that specific disability category
membership should not be a determining factor for considering participation (see
*Appendix* 5.1B).

#### 5.1G Parents Informed of AA-AAAS Consequences 

The Parent FAQ section of the General Administration Manual makes it clear that
parents must be informed of the potential consequences of having their child
assessed against alternate achievement standards, including diploma options.
Parents are also informed that alternate achievement standards are designed to
reflect a significant reduction in depth, breadth, and complexity and are
therefore not comparable to general academic achievement standards (see
*Appendix* 2.3, p. 28-32).

#### 5.1H State Ensures ORExt Promotes Access to the General Education Curriculum

The ORExt is strongly linked to the CCSS/ORSci/NGSS, as evidenced by our linkage
study results (see *Appendix* 3.1A). The claim is based on the following
warrants: (a) ORExt items are aligned to the Essentialized Standards; (b) the
Essentialized Standards are strongly linked to the grade level content
standards; therefore (c) the ORExt items are strongly linked to grade level
content expectations. It is thus expected that the ORExt promotes access to the
general education curriculum by assessing general education content that has
been reduced in depth, breadth, and complexity yet maintains the highest
possible standard for SWSCD.

In addition, ODE commissioned BRT to work with Oregon teachers of SWSCD in the
2015-16 school year to develop a variety of curricular and instructional
resources that are aligned to the Essentialized Standards. These resources
include: (a) curricular templates, (b) video tutorials, and (c) supporting
documents that provide specific guidance regarding how to develop lesson plans,
Present Levels of Academic and Functional Performance (PLAAFP) statements, and
Individualized Education Program (IEP) goals and objectives that are aligned
with the Essentialized Standards. It is also expected that the essentialization
process will generalize to many students who are performing off grade level, not
merely to SWSCD. All resources are published on a BRT-sponsored website at
\color{link} [BRT link](http://lms.brtprojects.org) \color{black}

### 5.2A - 5.2C Procedures for Including ELs 

In addition to the programmatic guidance provided in *Appendix* 1.4A.1 related
to EL program eligibility and services, ODE also provides guidance relevant to
the inclusion of ELs in the statewide assessment program in *Appendix* 1.4.2.
Though the ORExt is currently published in English, an appropriately qualified
interpreter can provide the assessment to any SWSCD from diverse language
backgrounds, including American Sign Language. ODE has developed a training
module to increase the standardization of ASL administration for its statewide
assessments, available at \color{link} [ASL
link](http://lms.brtprojects.org).\color{black}

Additional information regarding the inclusion of ELs in Oregon's general
assessments is provided in the general assessment Peer Review evidence.

### 5.3 Accommodations 

All statewide accommodation guidance is published in the Accessibility Manual
(see *Appendix* 2.3A.1), outlining the universal tools and designated supports
available to all students, and accommodations, available only to students with
disabilities or students served by Section 504 Plans. In addition, the manual
defines the supports as embedded, where they are provided by the online test
engine (e.g., calculator, text-to-speech), or non-embedded, where they must be
provided by a qualified assessor (e.g., read aloud, scribe). The manual also
makes it clear that these supports are content-area specific, as a universal
tool in one content area may be an accommodation in another.

#### 5.3A Appropriate Accommodations are Available for SWD/ Section 504

Appropriate accommodations for the ORExt are published in *Appendix* 2.3A.1, p.
36-43. Additional accommodations for all statewide assessments are also
published in this manual. The Oregon Accommodations Panel reviews the
appropriateness of the supports listed annually. Practitioners may also request
the addition of an accommodation through a formal process (see *Appendix* E:
Approval Process for New Accessibility Supports within the manual, *Appendix*
2.3A.1, p. 100-102).

#### 5.3B Appropriate Accommodations are Available for ELs 

As noted in Sections 5.2A-C, the ORExt is accessible in any communication
modality through the use of an interpreter. Appropriate accommodations for the
ORExt are published in *Appendix* 2.3A.1, p. 36-43. Additional accommodations
for all statewide assessments are also published in this manual. The Oregon
Accommodations Panel reviews the appropriateness of the supports listed
annually. Practitioners may also request the addition of an accommodation
through a formal process (see *Appendix* E: Approval Process for New
Accessibility Supports within the manual, *Appendix* 2.3A.1, p. 100-102).

#### 5.3C Accommodations are Appropriate and Effective 

In addition to the evidence gathered during the linkage study (see *Appendix*
3.1A), which suggests that the ORExt items were accessible and free of bias even
before final editing, the appropriateness of the supports listed in *Appendix*
2.3A.1 is reviewed annually by the Oregon Accommodations Panel. Practitioners
may also request the addition of an accommodation through a formal process (see
*Appendix* E: Approval Process for New Accessibility Supports within the manual,
*Appendix* 2.3A.1, p. 100-102). ODE is collecting accommodations codes for the
ORExt from Qualified Assessors who opt to enter this information in order to
make performance comparisons feasible. It is hoped that this process will be
required by spring 2018. The consequential validity study for 2018 will include
questions regarding the appropriateness of the available accommodations, as
well.

#### 5.3D Accommodations are Appropriate and Effective

ODE has a formal process stakeholders can use to request accommodations that are
not already published in the Accessibility Manual (see *Appendix* E: Approval
Process for New Accessibility Supports within the manual, *Appendix* 2.3A.1, p.
100-102).

### 5.4A - 5.4E Monitoring Test Administration for Special Populations

ODE monitoring of test administration in its districts and schools is elaborated
within the general assessment Peer Review evidence and is therefore not
addressed here.

## Critical Element 6 - Academic Achievement Standards and reporting

### 6.1 State Adoption of Alternate Academic Achievement Standards for SWSCD

The Oregon Extended assessment (ORExt), Oregon's Alternate Assessment based on
Alternate Academic Achievement Standards (AA-AAAS), is part of the Oregon
Statewide Assessment System. The ORExt is administered to Oregon students with
the most significant cognitive disabilities (SWSCD) in English language arts and
mathematics in Grades 3-8 and 11. The ORExt is administered in science in Grades
5, 8, & 11. The ORExt links to the CCSS in English language arts and
mathematics. The new ORExt is dually linked to Oregon's former science
standards, as well as to the NGSS. Results from the English language arts and
math administrations are included in calculations of participation and
performance for Annual Measurable Objectives (AMO) - a provision of the No
Child Left Behind Act (NCLB). Science participation is also included as part of
the Title 1 Assessment System requirements, and is administered in grades 5, 8,
& 11.

The revised ORExt is built upon a vertical scale in order to support reliable
determinations of annual academic growth in ELA and mathematics in Grades 3-8.
The complete vertical scaling plan and operational item selection decision rules
are located in *Appendix* 2.2.1.

#### 6.1A State Formally Adopted Alternate Academic Achievement Standards 

The State Board of Education formally adopted the AAAS and achievement level
descriptors (ALDs) on June 25, 2015 (see *Appendix* 6.1A.1). The ELA, Math, and
Science AAAS, including both the ALDs and the requisite cut scores are included
in *Appendix* 6.1.A.2.

#### 6.1B State Applies AAAS to All Public School SWSCD in Tested Grades 

The state applies the AAAS to all public school-served SWSCD who participate in
the ORExt in Grades 3-8 & 11 in English language arts and mathematics, and in
Grades 5, 8, & 11 in science.

#### 6.1C State's AAAS Include At Least Three Levels, ALDs, and Cut Scores 

The alternate academic achievement standards in Oregon are composed of four
levels (though only three are required). In descending order, they are (a) Level
1, (b) Level 2, (c) Level 3, and (d) Level 4. Level 1 and Level 2 performances
represent proficient achievement, while the bottom two levels represent
achievement that is not yet proficient. The procedures followed to develop
Oregon's alternate academic achievement standards were consistent with Title 1
assessment system requirements, including the establishment of cut scores, where
relevant. In order to define four levels of proficiency, Oregon set three cut
scores across all subject areas: (a) to separate Level 1 from Level 2, (b) to
separate Level 2 from Level 3, and, (c) to separate Level 3 from Level 4. The
alternate academic achievement standards in English language arts, mathematics,
and science for the ORExt, including the achievement level descriptors (ALDs)
and cut scores, were established during standard setting meetings held on June
15 (science), 16 (mathematics), and 17 (English language arts).

### 6.2 Achievement Standard Setting 

Standard Setting meetings were held at the University of Oregon in Eugene, OR on
June 15, 2015 (Science), June 16, 2015 (Mathematics), and June 17, 2015 (English
language arts).  A total of 53 standard setters were involved in the process: 11
in Science, and 21 in both English language arts and Mathematics. Panelists were
assembled in grade level teams of three, where two members were special
educators and one member was a content specialist.

The panelists were highly educated. Over 90% of the panel possessed a Master's
degree or higher. Fifty-seven (57%) percent of the panelists had over 11 years
of teaching experience. Seventy-six percent (76%) of the panelists had some
experience working with students with significant cognitive disabilities with
64% licensed as Special Educators. The majority of panel members were female
(87%), from the Northwest of the state (87%), and White (83%). No panel member
self-identified with Oregon's major minority population (Hispanic).

In addition to the live training during standard setting meetings, panelists
were asked to complete several training requirements prior to the standard
setting meetings, which oriented them to the student population of students with
significant cognitive disabilities (SWSCDs), the Oregon Extended Assessment test
design and history, as well as the bookmarking standard setting method.
Panelists were quite confident in their preparation and final judgments, as
evidenced by responses to the questions: (a) " The training helped me understand
the bookmark method and how to perform my role as a standard setter."  (b) "I am
confident about the defensibility and appropriateness of the final recommended
cut scores." and, (c) "Overall, I am confident that the standard setting
procedures allowed me to use my experience and expertise to recommend cut scores
for the ORExt." The hearty majority of standard setters strongly agreed with
these statements, while all participants agreed.

The nine-step process implemented for these standard setting meetings was based
on Hambleton & Pitoniak (2006) as reported by R.L. Brennan (Educational
Measurement, 4th Edition, pp. 433-470). Standard setting evaluation questions
posed to participants were adapted from Cizek's Setting Performance Standards
(2012). Standard setters set cut scores and recommended Achievement Level
Descriptors (ALDs) for the Oregon State Board of Education to consider. The cut
scores were articulated to reflect vertical development, or at least
maintenance, of expectations across grades in a manner that respected standard
setter judgments to the greatest possible degree. Six changes were made in ELA
and Mathematics. Science is not built upon a vertical scale, so no cut score
adjustments were necessary in Science. The cut scores are listed below.

English language arts (ELA) table here:

Mathematics table here:

Science table here:

Note: The ELA and Math vertical scales for the ORExt are centered on 200 in
grades 3-8 and can be used to document year-to-year growth. None of the other
scales should be used for longitudinal comparisons. All Grade 11 scales are
independent and centered on 900. The grade 5 Science scale is independent and
centered on 500, while the Grade 8 Science scale is independent and centered on
800. An independent auditor evaluated the bookmarking standard setting process.
The auditor's comprehensive report can be found in *Appendix* 6.2.2.

### 6.3 Challenging and Aligned Academic Achievement Standards 

Oregon educators initially evaluated new Oregon Essentialized Assessment
Frameworks in two respects. First, educators were asked to determine the
appropriateness of the standards selected for inclusion and exclusion in the
Essentialized Standards (yes/no). Second, the level of linkage between the
Essentialized Standards and grade level content standard was evaluated (0 = no
link, 1 = sufficient link, 2 = strong link). Summary results are provided in the
tables below. A comprehensive essentialized standard to grade level standard
linkage study, as well as essentialized standard to item alignment study, is
provided in *Appendix* 3.1A.

### 6.4 Reporting 

Oregon's reporting system facilitates appropriate, credible, and defensible
interpretation and use of its assessment data. With regard to the ORExt, the
purpose is to provide the state technically adequate student performance data to
ascertain proficiency on grade level state content standards for students with
significant cognitive disabilities (see Sections 3 and 4). In addition, the
state makes it clear that results from the Oregon Extended are not comparable to
results from the SBA/OAKS (see *Appendix* 2.3, p. 29-31). Nevertheless, the test
meets rigorous reliability expectations (see Section 4.1). Validity is
considered here as an overarching summation of the Oregon Extended assessment
system, as well as the mechanisms that Oregon uses to continuously improve the
ORExt assessment (see *Appendix* 2.3B.10).

#### 6.4A Public Reporting 

Oregon reports participation and assessment results for all students and for
each of the required subgroups in its reports at the school, district, and state
levels. The state does not report subgroup results when these results would
reveal personally identifiable information about an individual student. The
calculation rule followed is that the number of students in the subgroup must
meet the minimum cell size requirement for each AMO decision: participation,
achievement in English language arts and math, attendance, and graduation, where
appropriate (see *Appendix* 2.6C).

#### 6.4B State Reports Interpretable Results 

Oregon develops and disseminates individual student data upon final
determination of accuracy. The state provides districts with individual student
reports (ISRs) that meet most relevant requirements. The state incorporated the
Standard Error of Measure (SEM) for each student score into the report
templates. The SEM associated with each cut score is provided in Section 4.1B.
Also, see the mock-up ISR in *Appendix* 6.4C.

#### 6.4C1 - C5 State Provides Individual Student Reports 

Oregon's student reports provide valid and reliable information regarding
achievement on the assessments relative to the AAS. The reliability of the data
is addressed in Section 4.1. Validity is considered here as an overarching
summation of the Oregon Extended assessment system, as well as the mechanisms
that Oregon uses to continuously improve the Oregon Extended assessment. The
ISRs clearly demonstrate the students' scale score relative the AAAS that is
relevant for that content area and grade level (see Section 4.4 and *Appendix*
6.4C). The Oregon ISRs provide information for parents, teachers, and
administrators to help them understand and address a student's academic needs.
These reports are displayed in a simple format that is easy for stakeholders to
understand. District representatives can translate results for parents as
necessary. Scaled score interpretation guidance is published in *Appendix* 2.1A.

## Conclusions and Next Steps 

In sum, the rigor of the procedural development and statistical outcomes of the
ORExt were substantive and support the assessments intended purpose. Procedural
evidence includes essentialized standards development, item development, item
content and bias reviews, an independent alignment study and item selection
based upon item characteristics. Outcome-related evidence included measure
reliability analyses, point measure biserials, outfit mean squares, item
difficulty and person ability distributions, and convergent and divergent
validity evidence. These sources of evidence were all quite good and provide
important validity evidence. 

The test development process adhered to procedural guidelines defined by the
AERA/APA/NCME Standards for Educational and Psychological Testing (2014), as
well as incorporating procedures that are known in the field to be best
practice. For example, an independent auditor evaluated alignment. In addition,
the ORExt reflects what highly qualified Oregon educators believe represents the
highest professional standards for the population of students with significant
cognitive disabilities, as evidenced in our consequential validity study by
teacher support of the academic content on the ORExt as well as the behaviors
sampled during test administration.

Dr. Dianna Carrizales conducted an independent alignment study consisting of
five evaluation components: a) standard selection for essentialization, b)
strength of linkage between essentialized standards and grade level content
standards, c) alignment between items and essentialized standards, d) alignment
between the essentialized standards and the achievement level descriptors, and
e) alignment between the achievement level descriptors and the ORExt test items.
Dr. Carrizales reported that, "In the three evaluations that involved
determining the relationship between standards and items, reviewers identified
sufficient to strong relationships among assessment components in all grades and
all subject areas. In the two evaluations involving Achievement Level
Descriptors, reviewers identified thirty instances of sufficient to strong
relationships out of thirty-four possible relationship opportunities resulting
in an overall affirmed relationship with areas for refinements identified."
Overall, documentation collected in the report suggests that the ORExt
assessment system is aligned.

The test reliabilities for the ORExt were quite high, suggesting that the
assessment items functioned consistently with the test as a whole. The
correlations between students' content scores across subjects were not overly
strong, implying that each test measures a distinct construct. The
classification consistency analyses demonstrate that the ORExt is appropriately
categorizing students into the proficient category, and capable of doing so in a
consistent manner. The vertical scale developed in 2014-15 appears to be
modeling incremental growth across Grades 3-8 in ELA and mathematics, as
intended. The Grade 7 mathematics test continued to demonstrate insufficient
item difficulties across the range of low, medium, and high item complexity,
however, and must again be amended in the 2017-18 school year. The ELA and
science assessments could continue to benefit from the addition of more
difficult items, as evidenced by comparisons of the average person abilities and
item difficulties. Mathematics assessments appear to be functioning quite well
in terms of person abilities and item difficulties, though some additional low
level items might help increase access for the group of students functioning at
that level.

The Oregon Observational Rating Assessment (ORora) results demonstrate that
approximately 17-25% of the SWSCD who participated in the ORExt also took the
ORora, depending upon grade level. A total of 755 students were administered the
ORora in the 2016-17 test administration. The participants were primarily
students with multiple, severe disabilities with very limited communication
systems. Analyses of missing data patterns for the ORExt demonstrated that QAs
were generally able to adhere to the discontinuation rules. Quantitative results
indicate that a total of 755 students across all tested grades were administered
the ORora. Response patterns on the ORExt were compared to ORora results to
determine what percentages of QAs were administering the ORora due to the
minimum participation rule and what percentage were administering the ORora of
their own volition. Analyses showed that 234 students were eligible to take the
ORora in English language arts, 241 students were eligible to take the ORora in
mathematics, and 86 were eligible to take the ORora in science. This means that
about 30 students per grade, per content area received five or fewer correct
responses within the first 15 items administered on the ORExt. Of the 561 test
records that met ORora eligibility requirements, 91 were not administered the
ORora. In addition, there were 82 students in ELA and Math, respectively, who
were administered the ORora without having participated in the ORExt (74 of
those students were the same students, across each content area, with eight
students unique to each content area, respectively).

The 2016-17 Oregon Consequential Validity study provides important information
for future administrations of the ORExt. The results demonstrate that the test
continues to be easy to administer and score and is providing an accessible and
appropriate representation of the knowledge and skills that should be required
of SWSCD in Oregon. Areas of requested improvement include the provision of a
tablet-based administration, which is already planned for 2017-18, and the
development of additional life skills items, which cannot be accomplished while
maintaining rigorous academic expectations that are linked to Oregon content
standards.

The 2016-17 Oregon Extended Assessment Pilot Tablet Administration demonstrated
that Oregon teachers highly value provision of a tablet-based administration of
the ORExt at the statewide level. Benefits of a tablet-based administration
included: increased student engagement, improved standardization, ease of use by
teachers, and resource protection (i.e., time, printing, expense). The results
also suggest that more robust systems are needed to support user access to the
testing application via an automatic username and password process. Focus Group
members also recommended that practice items be developed in a tablet format so
qualified assessors and students can practice with the tablet administration in
preparation for the ORExt test window.

Documenting evidence of validity remains an ongoing and continuous process. Our
efforts to continue to improve the assessment system are outlined below, as well
as in Sections 3 and 4 above. We also have studies planned over the course of
the next three years that will help to solidify the evidence that is
accumulating. All of the evidence we have at hand suggests that the ORExt is
sufficient to its stated purpose of providing reliable determinations of student
proficiency at the test level in order to support systems level analysis of
district and state programs. The ORExt will hopefully continue to improve over
time due to field-testing and constant monitoring and review, and additional
validity evidence will be gathered.

As mentioned above in Section 3.1A, data are presented to support the claim that
Oregon's AA-AAAS provides the state technically adequate student performance
data to ascertain proficiency on grade level state content standards for
students with significant cognitive disabilities - which is its defined purpose.
In this technical report, we have provided content validity evidence related to
the ORExt test development process (i.e., essentialization process, linkage
study, distributed item review, test blueprint, item writer training and
demographics, and item reviewer training and demographics), ORExt test
reliability evidence, and ORExt consequential validity evidence. Further
analyses over the coming years are planned to continue the development of
technical documentation for overall construct validity of the ORExt. The
technical documentation plan for the 2016 through 2019 school years is provided
below:
