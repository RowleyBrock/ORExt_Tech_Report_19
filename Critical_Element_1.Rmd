## Critical Element 1: Statewide System of Standards and Assessments

### 1.1 State Adoption of Academic Content Standards for All Students

The Oregon State Board of Education (SBE) adopted new, challenging academic
content standards, the \color{link}[Common Core State Standards
(CCSS)](https://www.oregon.gov/ode/educator-resources/standards/Pages/default.aspx)\color{black},
in English language arts and mathematics in Grades K-12 on October 28, 2010.
These CCSS are utilized for all students in Oregon's public schools. Oregon was
actively involved in the development of the CCSS, as the Oregon Department of
Education (ODE), the Educational Enterprise Steering Committee (EESC), Oregon's
Education Service Districts, and school district representatives provided
feedback on the draft CCSS standards.

Similarly, the SBE adopted the \color{link}[Next Generation Science Standards
(NGSS)](https://www.oregon.gov/ode/educator-resources/standards/science/Pages/Science-Standards.aspx)
\color{black}  on March 6, 2014. The NGSS establish learning targets for all
students in Oregon's public schools in Grades K-12. The ODE and the Oregon
Science Content and Assessment Panel provided direct feedback related to the
NGSS. The NGSS are being phased in over time instructionally, so students are
being assessed relative to the Oregon Science (ORSci) standards that were
adopted in 2009.

The newly adopted academic content standards were then reduced in depth,
breadth, and complexity through a process called essentialization. The new
\color{link}[Essentialized Assessment Frameworks
(EAFs)](http://www.brtprojects.org/publications/training-modules) \color{black}
were then used for item writing for the ORExt. The tables below provide examples
of essentialized standards in grades 5, 8, & 11 in the subject areas of English
language arts (ELA), mathematics, and science. In the right column are
designations for estimated difficulty of an item: L (low), M (medium), and H
(high). More information on the essentialization process can be found in section
1.2.

See *Appendix* 1.1 for a User Guide that explains the development process and
intended uses for the EAFs.

### 1.2 Coherent and rigorous Academic Content Standards 

The CCSS, ORSci, and NGSS define what students in Oregon should know and be able
to do by the time they graduate from high school. These CCSS, which were
developed by national stakeholders and education experts, have been determined
to be coherent and rigorous by researchers at the Fordham Institute (see
*Appendix* 1.2). They were also developed with wide stakeholder involvement,
particularly here in Oregon. The new ORExt is linked directly to the content in
the CCSS in English language arts (reading, writing, & language) and
mathematics. The ORExt is dually linked to the ORSci as well as the NGSS. The
NGSS are widely accepted by most relevant science instruction organizations as
reflective of rigorous and coherent science concepts.

The new Essentialized Assessment Frameworks (EAFs) are publicly available. A
User Guide is provided to instruct educators regarding the intended uses of the
Essentialized Standards (EsSt), including the development of Present Levels of
Academic Achievement and Functional Performance (PLAAFP) and Individualized
Education Program (IEP) goals and objectives. The basic essentialization process
employed to generate essentialized standards and write aligned items for the
ORExt is outlined below. The process can also be used to support the development
of curricular and instructional materials, founded in research-based pedagogy.

### 1.3 Required Assessments 

The ORExt assessments were administered in the 2018-19 school year in ELA and
math in Grades 3-8 and Grade 11; science is assessed in Grades 5, 8, &
11. This assessment plan meets the requirements for grade level assessment in
Grades 3-8 and once in high school (Grades 10-12) for ELA and mathematics, while
science is assessed once in the 3-5 grade band, once in the 6-9 grade band, and
once in the 10-12 grade band:

| **Content Area**      | **Grade 3** | **Grade 4** | **Grade 5** | **Grade 7** | **Grade 8** | **Grade 11** |
| :-------------------- | :---------- | :---------- | :---------- | :---------- | :---------- | :----------- |
| English Language Arts | X           | X           | X           | X           | X           | X            |
| Mathematics           | X           | X           | X           | X           | X           | X            |
| Science               |             |             | X           |             | X           | X            |

### 1.4 Policies for Including All Students in Assessments 

Originally, Oregon statute required that all students participate in statewide
assessments, with exceptions allowed for district-approved parent request for
assessment waivers (parent opt-out requests) related to student disability or
religious beliefs (see Oregon Administrative Rule, OAR ยง 581-022-0612).

Exception of Students with Disabilities from State Assessment Testing: (1) For
the purposes of this rule a "student with a disability" is a student identified
under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, consistent with OAR
chapter 581, division 015, or a student with a disability under Section 504 of
the Rehabilitation Act of 1973; (2) A public agency shall not exempt a student
with a disability from participation in the Oregon State Assessment System or
any district wide assessments to accommodate the student's disability unless the
parent has requested such an exemption.
    
However, House Bill 2655 established a Student Bill of Rights on January 1,
2016, which permitted parents or adult students to annually opt-out of Oregon's
statewide summative assessments, pursuant to OAR ยง 581-022-1910.

The Governor published a memorandum for Superintendents, Principals, and
District Test Coordinators related to the change (see *Appendix* 1.4.1).

The expectation that all students in the assessed grades participate, including
students with disabilities, is elaborated clearly and pervasively across all
guidance documents. For example in the Oregon Test Administration Manual (TAM),
where it states that, "All students enrolled in grades 3-8 and in high school
must take the required Oregon Statewide Assessments offered at their enrolled
grade, including students re-enrolled in the same grade as in the prior year,
unless the student receives a parent-requested exemption..." (see *Appendix*
1.4.2, p. 93).

#### 1.4A English Learners 

English learners are included as appropriate in Oregon's statewide assessment
system. (see *Appendix* 1.4A.1, pp. 31-33). The Smarter Balanced assessment
directions are translated into multiple languages and available via the Oaks
portal. OAR 581-022-0620 (2) requires ODE to provide translated OAKS assessments
for populations at or above 9% in grades K-12 within three years after the
school year in which the language exceeds the threshold (see *Appendix* 1.4A.2).
In addition, the accommodations available to students who participate in the
ORExt include translation into the native language, where appropriate (see
*Appendix* 2.3A1, pp. 36-43).

#### 1.4B Native Language Assessments 

The ORExt is not administered in a native language format, though it can be
translated into a student's home language.

### 1.5 Participation Data 

Oregon's participation data indicate that most students in the tested grade
levels are included in our assessment system. The students with disabilities
subgroup did not meet minimum participation requirements in 2017-18, the most
current data available at the time of this report, in English language arts or
mathematics, with rates at 87.5% and 86.4%, respectively. See the table below
for a summary of participation. Documentation of this requirement is provided
within the Annual Performance Report, Indicator B3, which is submitted to the
United States Department of Education's (USED's) Office of Special Education
Programs (OSEP). Participation and performance summaries are provided below.
Additional information regarding state performance is published in the 2017-18
